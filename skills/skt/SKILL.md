description: 'Skill-lifecycle orientation and change management for skill-manager homes, via the `skt` CLI. Use at SESSION START to learn what is loaded and where you are standing — which skill-manager skills and plugins are installed, which support change management, which have a NEW VERSION AVAILABLE and how to pull/sync them, which home tier this session writes (root ~/.skill-manager, project <repo>/.skill-manager, or a ticket worktree home), and whether you are inside an epic, a ticket, or an active spec workflow. Use whenever you edited a skill in your home and need it to survive — sync it up a tier, publish it to its own repo — or see "please sync with root to publish changes globally". Use for the worktree ticket lifecycle: `skt ticket new/close` creates and tears down a ticket worktree WITH its own Skill Manager home, and `skt ticket list/sweep` enumerates the ticket worktrees of an epic and retires them in one safety-gated pass instead of a hand-rolled `git worktree remove --force` loop. Trigger on: "what skills are loaded", "am I in a ticket/epic", "update this skill", "new version", "sync skills", "publish my skill edit", "start/finish a ticket", "clean up/retire/sweep worktrees", "reclaim disk space from worktrees", session startup orientation.'

# skt

One CLI for the questions every session has and nobody used to answer:
*what is loaded, where am I standing, is anything stale, and how does my
skill edit survive this worktree?*

> **Orienting yourself? Run `skt status` and stop reading.** It answers all
> four of the questions a session starts with — which home tier you are in,
> what is above it, the exact command that carries an edit out of this home,
> and which homes you must never write — in about 360 tokens. **Everything
> below this line is reference, and reading it to orient yourself costs
> roughly forty times more than running the command.**
>
> That number is measured, not asserted. Fresh agents inheriting nothing were
> asked those four questions against a real home: they answered the tier from
> `skt status` and then went hunting for the other three, spending 10,879
> tokens at the worktree tier and 21,186 at the root tier — reading a
> 13,000-token reference page and, at root, skt's own Python source. The
> command already knew every answer. It just did not say the last three out
> loud, and this page did not tell anyone to stop.

```bash
skt status            # startup report: units, plugins, home tier, epic/ticket state, CLI version
skt check             # new-version-available, unit errors, stale artifacts, a stale OR too-old skill-manager
skt sync <unit>       # pull a unit to its latest pushed source
skt ticket new <T>    # ticket worktree + its own Skill Manager home, one command
skt ticket close <T>  # teardown through the close-out gate
skt ticket list       # every ticket worktree here, and what blocks retiring it
skt ticket sweep      # retire many at once — dry run unless you pass --yes
skt publish [<unit>]  # a home-edited skill -> up one tier -> its own git repo
skt build [<id>]      # rebuild a derived artifact whose inputs you changed
skill-manager home drift --ack --home=<home>   # clear the launch gate a sync warns about; the home is a flag, never positional
```

`skt` is on `PATH` in every home **that installed this plugin**
(`<home>/bin/cli/skt`). `skt --help` is authoritative for syntax.

- `skt check` reporting `unverifiable (remote unreachable)` means currency could
  NOT be established for those units — say so; do not rebuild the check from
  `git ls-remote` or the lockfile.
- A unit absent from `skill-manager list` is not installed, so it cannot be
  synced — install it: `skill-manager install github:<owner>/<repo>` (the coord
  names the repo, e.g. `github:haydenrear/git-issue-workflow-skill`). `sync`
  only refreshes a unit that is already installed.

**A home does not inherit it.** Project and worktree homes are copies of the
home above them, so a home cloned from one that never installed `skt` has no
`bin/cli/skt` and no `plugins/tla-spec-dev/` — and then none of this page is loaded in
that session either, which is why you are unlikely to be reading this when it
matters.

That is not hypothetical, and the fix is one command. **As measured on
2026-08-24**, the skill-manager repository's project home and a ticket worktree
cloned from it each held four skills, no plugins and no `skt` — while the
`skill-project.toml` that home is meant to realize declared the plugin. A single
`skill-manager project resolve` against the worktree home installed `skt` and
`skill-manager` into it and the gap closed. **So if you are reading this from a
home that has `skt`, that measurement is history and not a description of where
you are standing** — which is the whole shape of the problem: a home is a copy
taken at an instant, and a sentence about one home is not a sentence about
another.

If `skt` is not there, nothing is broken and nothing is lost — you are simply
one tier down from where it was installed. Every `skt` verb is a wrapper:

| instead of | run |
| --- | --- |
| `skt status` / `skt check` | `skill-manager list`, `skill-manager home describe --json` |
| `skt sync <unit>` | `skill-manager sync <unit> --git-latest` |
| `skt publish <unit>` | `skill-manager home sync` then `skill-manager unit publish` (the two legs below) |
| `skt ticket new/close` | `<home>/skills/skt/scripts/wt new\|close <TICKET>` — this plugin's own script, so a home without skt has neither |

To get the plugin itself into this checkout's home, declare it in the
checkout's `skill-project.toml` and run `skill-manager project resolve`
against **that** home.

## Derived artifacts — read this before deciding a home is broken

`skt status` and `skt check` report artifact state into your opening context, so
every session is told artifacts exist. **What they are, what a clone inherits
versus merely declares, and when to rebuild is in
`references/derived-artifacts.md`.**

Go there if you are asking any of:

- what is a derived artifact, and what names them?
- what did my worktree home inherit from its parent, and what did it only
  declare?
- **a command on my `PATH` refused instead of running — `exit 86`** — or is
  simply not there at all;
- is this home broken, or is this what a healthy clone looks like?
- should I rebuild something, and with what command?

Read it rather than the source. The last two agents who read the source instead
got the root cause wrong, in opposite directions, and the page names both.

## Two different things `skt check` says about skill-manager itself

They answer different questions and they can disagree, so read which one
fired before acting:

- **`cli-version`** — *a newer release exists.* Asks brew. Informational; a
  local build never triggers it, because a branch build's base version says
  nothing about which commits it carries.
- **`cli-floor`** — *the installed CLI is OLDER THAN THIS PLUGIN REQUIRES.*
  Asks nothing: it compares the installed version against a number the plugin
  declares, in one file, `bootstrap-floor.toml` at the plugin root. Move the
  floor there and nowhere else.

The floor exists because `cli-version` could not see the case that cost six
days. skill-manager 0.28.1 predated a fix this plugin depended on, brew's own
formula cache was equally stale, and so brew answered "you are current" — a
CLI six days older than the fix it depended on was indistinguishable from a
current one at every surface an agent can see (SI-22-DF-01). A comparison
against a declared number cannot be made to agree by any cache.

**`cli-floor` WARNS. It refuses nothing** — not an install, not a session, not
a command (`GOAL-no-new-gates`). Like every other notification it makes
`skt check` exit `10`, which is skt's *notify* code rather than a failure:
`hooks/skt-session-start.sh` translates it into printed session context and
itself exits `0`. Nothing else in the substrate reads that exit code.

## When `skt check` says a unit is NOT stale

**A project or worktree home tracks the repository's pin, not the unit's
trunk.** When the checkout's `skill-project.toml` gives a unit a
`revision`, `skt check` in that home compares against the pin, never the
remote tip: at the pin it lists the unit under `pinned by
skill-project.toml (nothing to pull)`; off the pin it emits `pin-drift`
with `restore the pin with: … project resolve --project-dir <repo>`. Do
not `skt sync` a pinned unit there — that pulls trunk and breaks the
repository that pinned it. The root home ignores pins and tracks trunk.

A unit whose installed hash disagrees with its remote tip is usually
behind it. Sometimes the home already knows better: the installer
records `errors[*].kind` when it leaves a store in a state it could not
finish, and for `MERGE_CONFLICT`, `NO_GIT_REMOTE` and
`NEEDS_GIT_MIGRATION` that record *is* the explanation for the
disagreement. `skt check` reads it first and emits a `unit-error`
notification in place of the pull prompt:

```
deploy-helm is not stale — its store is mid-merge (MERGE_CONFLICT):
unmerged paths remain. Local work is preserved at stash@{0}.
Syncing re-runs the merge that made them.
  resolve with: git -C <home>/skills/deploy-helm status
```

**Do not answer this with `skt sync` or `skill-manager sync --merge`.**
`--merge` is documented as the flag that *sets* `MERGE_CONFLICT`, and
the state clears only when the store has no unmerged files left. The
stash the message names is somebody's uncommitted work and any reset of
the store destroys it. Resolve in the store directory, `git add` +
`git commit`, and the next command clears the error by itself.

## When a skt command relays a failure

`skt ticket new`, `skt publish` and `skt sync` all shell out — to
`bootstrap-home.sh`, or to this home's own `bin/cli/skill-manager` — and
when one of those fails you get the child's own words, not a summary of
them:

```
error: home bootstrap failed (exit 1); worktree and branch rolled back
cause: skill-manager: refusing to run against a home you did not name.
         you named:  /repo/wt-3/.skill-manager
         this shim would have edited: /Users/x/.skill-manager
fix:   skill-manager home shims --root /repo/wt-3/.skill-manager   # ...
log:   /tmp/bootstrap-home-A3Uj8x.log
--- bootstrap-home.sh said ---
  <the whole output, or its head and tail with the elision counted>
```

Read it in this order and believe the `cause:` block over everything
else — it is the child's text, lifted out so a long log cannot bury it.

**Exit 79 is a cross-home refusal and is never a version problem.** A
`bin/cli` shim binds the home it LIVES in and refuses when
`SKILL_MANAGER_HOME` names a different one, rather than editing the
other home silently. Upgrading anything changes nothing. Either the pin
serves a home that is not the one it lives in — regenerate it with
`skill-manager home shims --root <home>` — or the environment names a
home this pin does not serve, and the environment is what moves. The
refusal names both homes; the `fix:` line picks the right one of the two.

Before skt 0.8.0 this printed only the child's LAST line, so a
provisioning failure read as a dangling sentence fragment
(skill-manager#264) and the diagnosis was only reachable by re-running
the bootstrap by hand.

## Startup disclosure

In Claude Code this plugin's `SessionStart` hook injects `skt status`
into every session automatically and performs the one bounded live
refresh of the check cache; the `PostToolUse` hook is cache-only — it
surfaces "new version available" notifications from that cached result
and never runs a check itself (every hook injection appends a line to
`<home>/logs/skt/hook.log`).
Harnesses without a hook runtime (codex, gemini) get the projected skt
skill plus an instruction snippet instead — the honest per-harness
matrix is `../unit-authoring/references/harness-capabilities.md`.

`skt ticket new/close` wraps `wt`, **this plugin's own script**. The raw
path form still works and is the fallback when `skt` is not on `PATH`:

```bash
"${SKILL_MANAGER_HOME:-$HOME/.skill-manager}/skills/skt/scripts/wt" new <TICKET>
```

`wt` is the door; the lifecycle behind it is `git-issue-workflow`'s and
`wt` resolves that unit at run time, refusing in one line when it cannot
(`$GIT_ISSUE_WORKFLOW_SCRIPTS` overrides).

## Retiring an epic's worktrees at the end: `list` and `sweep`

An epic keeps every ticket worktree standing until integration is done
and then retires them all at once. **Do not hand-loop
`git worktree remove --force`** — that is `rm -rf` with extra steps: it
deletes each worktree's Skill Manager home, which is gitignored, so the
loss appears in no diff, no PR and no fan-out.

```bash
skt ticket list                       # read-only: what is standing, and what blocks it
skt ticket sweep                      # the plan. Changes NOTHING without --yes
skt ticket sweep --target origin/main --yes  # retire every worktree that passes its own gate
skt ticket sweep --epic <slug> --yes  # one epic's worktrees only
```

Run it **from the primary checkout**. `sweep` refuses the worktree it is
running in and never touches the primary.

`--epic <slug>` resolves `epic/<slug>` (local or remote) and refuses if it
cannot. A worktree is one of its tickets when its ticket id is in the epic's
`ticket_plan.yaml`, or its tip is contained in the epic branch. The epic's
own worktree is never swept by `--epic`; remove it on its own once the
epic is finalized.

`--yes` needs a containment target. With no `--epic`, no `--target` and no
single discoverable `epic/*` branch, the dry run still lists every worktree
(noting that containment was not checked), but `--yes` refuses and removes
nothing: pass `--epic <slug>` or `--target <ref>` (e.g. `--target origin/main`).

Each worktree is measured *again* immediately before it is removed, and
any one of these makes it **skipped, not removed** — reported, with the
pass carrying on:

- uncommitted changes, or a stash entry made on that worktree's branch;
- commits not pushed, or not contained in the epic/target branch;
- a non-clean `skill-manager home close-out --home <worktree-home>
  --into <primary-home>` verdict — the same gate `skt ticket close` runs.

Removal is `git worktree remove`; `--force` is never passed. Exit `0`
means the pass completed (skips included — a skip is the gate working),
`1` means something failed, `9` means the destination home is `frozen`
and the pass was abandoned.

The summary reports a **free-space delta**, measured with `statvfs`
before and after, and no per-worktree size. These homes are cloned
copy-on-write, so `du` bills every shared block to every copy and
over-reports by roughly 30x — a home `du` called 1.1 GB cost 33.7 MB of
real space.

## The three-tier home model, in one table

| Tier | Path | Updated by | Your obligation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| root | `~/.skill-manager` | operator installs; `skt sync` | publish local edits globally (`skt check` prompts here) |
| project | `<repo>/.skill-manager` | cloned from root; refreshed via `wt`/`skt ticket` imports | pull-side by default — but an edit made *here* owes the same two legs as any other |
| worktree | `<worktree>/.skill-manager` | cloned from project at `ticket new` | get edits OUT before teardown (`skt publish`; the close gate refuses otherwise) |

Homes are real copies, never symlinks. An edit inside one is **in no git
diff** — `skt publish` is how it survives: `home sync` moves it one tier
up (and no further), `unit publish` is the only route to the skill's own
repository and to other machines.

A copy of a home is not a copy of everything the home can *do*: the derived
artifacts it holds are inherited or declared rather than rebuilt, which is
`references/derived-artifacts.md`.

## This skill's reference pages

| Question | Page |
| --- | --- |
| What is an artifact, what does a clone inherit versus declare, when do I rebuild? | `references/derived-artifacts.md` |
| Which harnesses get hooks, and which get a projected skill instead? | `../unit-authoring/references/harness-capabilities.md` |
| The deep unit-authoring schemas | `../unit-authoring/references/` (see the `unit-authoring` skill) |

## Related skills in this plugin

- `unit-authoring` (sibling skill): authoring installable units —
  SKILL.md frontmatter, `skill-manager.toml`, `plugin.json`,
  dependencies, distribution. The deep schemas live in this plugin's
  `../unit-authoring/references/` pages.
- `skill-manager` (separate unit): install/bind/project/home plumbing;
  its CLI help is authoritative for those.
