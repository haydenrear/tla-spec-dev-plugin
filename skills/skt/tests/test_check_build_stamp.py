"""`skt check` names the builds that produced its verdict (skill-manager#338).

Asserted on ONE home judged through TWO skill-manager builds. A single-build
test cannot tell "the build is printed" from "a constant is printed"; this
one rewrites the home's pin between two passes and requires each verdict to
name its own build, the two verdicts to differ, and nothing but the build to
have moved.
