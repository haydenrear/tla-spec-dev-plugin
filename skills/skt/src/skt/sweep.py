"""`skt ticket list|sweep` — retire an epic's worktrees in one pass.

An epic keeps its ticket worktrees alive until the end: a ticket's
worktree is where its reviewer looks, and the epic owner wants them all
standing until integration is done. So the retirement is not N
independent `skt ticket close` calls spread over a month — it is one
sweep at the end, over a dozen directories, and doing it by hand is
where the safety checks get skipped. The hand-loop that motivated this
was `for d in ../wt-*; do git worktree remove --force $d; done`, which
is `rm -rf` with extra steps: it takes the worktree's Skill Manager home
with it, and that home is gitignored, so the loss appears in no diff.

Two verbs, and the split is deliberate:

  `list`   read-only. Every ticket worktree this checkout created, with
           the flags that decide whether it may be retired. Nothing is
           removed and nothing is written.
  `sweep`  the pass. Refuses by default — with no `--yes` it prints the
           same plan `list` would justify and changes nothing.

The safety model
----------------

**Per worktree, re-checked immediately before that worktree is
removed.** Not once up front: a sweep over a dozen homes takes minutes
(the close-out gate is a full compare of two homes, per worktree), and
an agent finishing a ticket in one of them halfway through the pass is
the normal case, not the exotic one. A plan computed at t=0 is a
description of the past. So :func:`inspect` runs again inside the
removal loop and the second answer is the one that decides.

Five things make a worktree **skipped, not removed**, and a skip is a
normal outcome that keeps the pass going:

  locked           git itself refuses; say so rather than discover it.
  uncommitted      the only state `git worktree remove` alone protects.
  stash entries    attributed by branch — see `_stash_entries`.
  unpushed commits the branch ref outlives the worktree, so this is not
                   a data-loss gate; it is the workflow one. Work that
                   never reached the remote has not been reviewed, and
                   retiring its worktree is how it gets forgotten.
  not contained    commits not in the epic/target branch: the ticket did
                   not land, whatever its branch says.

and one more that is not a property of the repository at all: the
worktree's Skill Manager home. `git worktree remove` deletes
`<worktree>/.skill-manager` without asking. Nothing in git can see that,
so the gate is `skill-manager home close-out --home <worktree-home>
--into <destination>`, which is the same gate `skt ticket close` runs,
here run per worktree. A non-clean verdict skips.

**The destination home is the MAIN working tree's**, resolved from the
primary checkout — never `homes.find_home(".")`. Run from inside a
worktree, that helper walks up from `$PWD` and finds the worktree's OWN
home, and a close-out gate whose `--home` and `--into` are the same
directory compares a home against itself and reports clean for
everything. The one path that must not have a plausible-looking bug is
the one deciding whether it is safe to delete a directory.

Two exit codes from that gate mean things the summary must not flatten
into "not clean" (documented in git-issue-workflow's `complete.md`):

  exit 2  the path passed to `--home` is not a home at all. Nothing was
          assessed, so nothing is printed — and the classic cause is
          passing the worktree directory instead of its `.skill-manager`,
          which is also the path `git worktree remove` takes. Counted as
          a FAILURE here, not a safety skip: it means this command's own
          derivation was wrong, or the home is broken.
  exit 9  the destination home's policy is `frozen`, so the gate was
          refused and nothing was attempted. That is a statement about
          the destination, not about any worktree — it will repeat
          identically for every one — so the pass is abandoned rather
          than emitting N identical skips.

Removal is `git worktree remove`, never `rm -rf`, and `--force` is never
passed: it is the flag whose whole purpose is to make a blocker go away,
and every blocker above is one this command exists to respect. The
primary checkout is never a candidate, and the worktree the command is
running in is refused explicitly — removing the directory you are
standing in is how a sweep becomes an incident.

Why free-space delta and not `du`
---------------------------------

These homes are cloned copy-on-write (APFS `clonefile`), so `du`
attributes every shared block to every copy and over-reports by roughly
30x: a home `du` calls 1.1 GB was measured to cost 33.7 MB of real
space. Reporting that number would tell an operator they are about to
reclaim thirty times what they will. So the only size this module
reports is the free-space delta over the whole pass, from
`os.statvfs` before and after, and no per-worktree size at all.

(Nothing here is re-exported from `skt/__init__.py`, deliberately: the
module is `skt.sweep` and its main entry point is `sweep`, so a
re-export would shadow one with the other depending on import order —
the collision `build_cmd.py` was renamed to avoid. Import it as
`from skt.sweep import sweep`.)

    2. its tip is CONTAINED in the epic ref — the ticket's work landed on

       the worktree directory name, or the epic ref is an ancestor of
       the tip (branched from the epic's current tip, not yet merged).

    (2) is what #390 was missing. The fallback used to be only (3), and
    its ancestry probe runs the other way: a ticket branched from an
    OLD epic tip and merged back is not a descendant of the epic's
    current tip, so on a finished epic with no plan every ticket was
    excluded — and the only worktree left to "match" was the epic's own.
    A plan miss does not veto (2): a ticket whose work is in the epic is
    part of it whatever its branch is called.
