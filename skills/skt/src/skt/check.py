"""`skt check` — new-version, sync-with-root, unit-error and stale-artifact.

Pull-side (every tier): compare each change-managed unit's installed
gitHash against its remote tip (`git ls-remote`). Push-side (ROOT tier
only): a unit's store checkout that is dirty or ahead of its remote is
work nobody else can see — prompt the publish. Project homes are
updated from `wt`-created imports, so they get pull-side messages only.

Both of those are inferences from hashes, and the home does not only
carry hashes: the installer records `errors[*].kind` when it leaves a
store in a state it could not finish. For the three kinds that describe
the STORE CHECKOUT itself (`STORE_BLOCKING_ERRORS`), that record is the
explanation for the disagreement the hash comparison would otherwise
diagnose on its own — so it is read FIRST, and it replaces both
verdicts rather than riding beside them.

The case this exists for, measured in the operator's project home:
three units record `MERGE_CONFLICT` with `stash@{0}` holding somebody's
uncommitted work, and `skt check` answered two of them with "new
version available — pull with: skt sync", which re-runs the merge that
made the conflict, and the third with "ahead of the remote tip", which
is true about hashes and silent about the unmerged paths. The remedy a
`unit-error` names is the one skill-manager's own `ReportUseCase.hint`
names — resolve in the store — never a skill-manager verb, because
`sync --merge` is documented as what SETS this state.

Artifact-side (every tier): a unit moving is only half the news. The
half that unblocks a fast fix is WHICH derived artifact went stale as a
result and the one command that lands it, so a third notification kind
rides beside the other two:

    artifact computeq is stale (deploy-helm moved a3f21c8 -> 9b17e40)
      rebuild with: skt build computeq

It is built ONLY from `skt.artifacts`' `rebuildable` set — an artifact
that is on disk, no longer describes its inputs, and that `skt build`
really produces. The operator's project home holds 55 stale artifacts
and 7 of those; 11 of the rest were declared and never built, which is a
lazily-built home's normal state and not news. Enumerating all 55 into
every session is the failure this filter exists to prevent, and the
counts for what it drops stay in the report under `artifacts`.

**The artifact probe is on the LIVE path and nowhere else.** It is a
subprocess, and `--cached` is contract-cache-only in every cache state
(below). `skt.artifacts` is imported INSIDE `collect()` rather than at
the top of this file, so nothing on the cached path can reach it — not
even by accident, because a module-scope import here would be circular
(`artifacts` -> `publish` -> `check`) and fail loudly at import time.

That is a statement about THIS module, not about the process. The real
hook path runs `cli.py`, which imports the `skt` package, whose
`__init__` re-exports the artifact surface — so `skt.artifacts` IS in
`sys.modules` by the time `check --cached` runs. Importing it costs no
spawn and no measurable time; what matters is that the cached path never
CALLS it, which is what the tests drive.

`--cached` is contract-cache-only: it reads the state file and NOTHING
else — no subprocess, no network, no fallback to a live check, whatever
state the cache is in. That is the path SKT-6 wires into tool-event
hooks, so a cold home must stay exactly as cheap as a warm one. The
report carries a typed `cache_state`:

  fresh    -> the cached result verbatim, plus `from_cache` metadata
  missing  -> no cache record exists; nothing was checked
  expired  -> a record exists but is past --ttl; its content is
              preserved under `stale` (text output labels each line
              [stale]) and is never presented as current

Exit codes: 0 = nothing to report; 10 = notifications exist. Both are
success — 10 exists so hooks can decide to inject without parsing.
`cache_state` missing/expired is the documented non-error outcome: exit
0 with empty top-level `notifications` (an absent result is "nothing to
report", and stale notifications must not re-fire as exit 10 on every
tool call). Refreshing is the live path's job — `skt check`, or the
SessionStart hook's bounded refresh — never the hook tool-event path's.

Both halves of the live path read the SAME clock. The remote tip comes
from `git ls-remote`; the local verdicts are then adjudicated against
that tip rather than against `@{upstream}`, which is a local ref only a
fetch moves. Units where the two agree and only the local ref disagrees
are reported under `upstream_stale` / `ahead_of_remote` and are NOT
notifications: a prompt to publish or pull with nothing behind it was
the defect. The adjudication is `merge-base --is-ancestor` in the store
checkout — local, clamped to the same deadline, no extra network — and
it runs only for units that would otherwise have produced a message.
`--cached` is untouched: it still costs exactly one state-file read.

The live path owns one wall-clock deadline (NETWORK_BUDGET_SECONDS),
shared by the remote and root-local phases: every git child runs in its
own process group and the whole group is SIGKILLed and reaped when its
clamped timeout fires, queued executor work is cancelled at the
deadline instead of awaited, and units left unresolved are reported
`unverifiable`. A refresh that resolved nothing writes no cache record,
and the record it does write lands by atomic rename — `--cached` must
never serve a failure, or a partial write, as a fresh success.

# does not know the kind still gets a `message`.
# 4: notifications of kind `unit-error` (ARTI-23). Additive again — the

# consumer filtering on `kind == "new-version"` sees FEWER rows than a v3
# record would have shown for the same home, because a store-blocking
# error now replaces that unit's pull prompt rather than riding beside it.
# 5: the record gained `cli` and notifications of kind `cli-version`
# (skill-manager#265's follow-on). Additive on the established terms — an
# older record has no `cli` key and every reader uses `.get` — and it fills
# the one gap that made every OTHER notification untrustworthy: skt could
# say a home's units were current while the binary reading them was a
# release behind, because skill-manager is a brew formula rather than a
# change-managed unit and nothing here had ever looked at it.
# 6: the record gained `skt_version` and `skill_manager_build`, and the `cli`
# block gained `build` (skill-manager#338, "every verdict names the build
# that produced it"). Additive on the established terms. A verdict about a
# home is a verdict BY a build: the same home read "nothing is damaged"
# under one skill-manager and carried 8 findings under another, one minute
# apart, and nothing in either output said which had answered.
# 7: the `cli` block gained `floor` and `below_floor`, and notifications of

# the v5 `cli-version` notification unable to see the case it was built for:
# `cli-version` asks BREW what the newest release is, and brew's own formula

    The remedy is deliberately NOT a skill-manager verb. Three facts from
    skill-manager's own source decide it for MERGE_CONFLICT:

      * `SyncCommand --merge`'s help says conflicts "leave the working
        tree in conflicted state and set MERGE_CONFLICT until resolved" —
        so `--merge` is what PRODUCES this state, not what clears it;
      * `LiveInterpreter` clears the error exactly when
        `GitOps.unmergedFiles(dir).isEmpty()` — the state is a fact about
        the store's working tree, and only resolving it there changes it;
      * `ReportUseCase.hint(MERGE_CONFLICT, ...)` already answers
        "resolve in <storeDir>, then `git add` + `git commit`".

    So `skt check` says what skill-manager already says, in the surface an
    agent actually reads, and adds the one thing the hint does not carry:
    the stash. The recorded message names `stash@{0}` when the conflict
    came from a stash pop, and that stash is somebody's uncommitted work —
