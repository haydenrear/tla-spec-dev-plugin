"""`skt ticket` — the worktree lifecycle, over this plugin's own `wt`.

skt does not reimplement or shell out to the `wt` path by hand: it
imports the typed Python surface (`skt.wt`) and adds skt's framing —
orientation after `new`, guided remedies on a refused `close`.

SI-17 moved that surface HERE, from git-issue-workflow, together with
the `scripts/wt` it drives. What stayed there is the lifecycle `wt`
delegates to — `lib.sh`, `new-change.sh`, `close-change.sh` — which is
why `UNIT` below still names that unit and why the remedies still point
at it: a home can carry skt and not git-issue-workflow, and then the
front door resolves while the rooms behind it do not.

`list` and `sweep` are the FLEET verbs and live in :mod:`skt.sweep`.
They take no TICKET, they do not go through `wt` — an epic retires a
dozen worktrees at once and `wt close` resolves exactly one ticket by
search — and `list` in particular must work in a repository where
git-issue-workflow is not importable at all, since answering "what is
still standing here?" is how an operator finds out what is wrong.
