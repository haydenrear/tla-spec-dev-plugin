# bootstrap-home.sh [--root DIR] [options]
#
# Give one checkout — a repo root or a worktree — its own Skill Manager home,
# so every agent launched from it reads and writes that home instead of the
# operator's global one.
#
# This is the ONLY implementation of that sequence. `new-change.sh` calls it
# for every worktree it creates, and a repo's own `scripts/agent-home.sh`
# locates and calls this same file. There is deliberately no second copy of
# the ordering rules: getting them wrong writes into the operator's home,
# which is the one failure this script exists to make impossible.
#
# The order is not cosmetic
# ------------------------
#   clone  ->  point SKILL_MANAGER_HOME at the clone  ->  everything else
#
# `project resolve`, `sync`, `install`, `bind` and friends all write into
# whatever `SKILL_MANAGER_HOME` names (`SkillStore.defaultStore()`), and
# `project resolve` additionally writes a child-home record and a binding
# ledger into that store. Run any of them before the clone exists and they
# land in the global home. So: `skill-manager home clone` is the first
# command, it is the only command that names the source home, and every
# command after it runs with SKILL_MANAGER_HOME exported to the clone.
# `require_local_home` re-asserts that before any mutating step, so the rule
# is enforced by the script rather than remembered by a caller.
#
# What it produces under <root>:
#   .skill-manager/                     the home (a clone of the source home)
#   .skill-manager/home.runtime.json    the launch descriptor (HomeDescriptor)
#   .skill-manager/home.policy.toml     live | frozen (HomePolicy)
#   .skill-manager/bin/launch/{claude,codex,gemini}   launcher shims
#   .claude/ .codex/ .gemini/           agent homes, at the paths the
#                                       descriptor's env block names
#
# Add those to the PARENT repo's root .gitignore, never to a file inside a
# constituent (INTEGRATION.md rule 2).

  DIR              Checkout to give a home to, positionally -- the same thing
                   --root names. Accepted because every other front door in
                   this pair takes its subject that way.
  --root DIR       Checkout to give a home to. Default: the nearest enclosing
                   git toplevel — which inside a constituent is the
                   CONSTITUENT, not the integration repo tracking its files.
  --source HOME    Home to clone from. Only ever read. Default: for a LINKED
                   WORKTREE, its project home (the main working tree's), which
                   is the home close-change.sh reconciles it back into; for a
                   main working tree, $SKILL_MANAGER_HOME, else ~/.skill-manager.
                   A --source that disagrees with a worktree's project home is
                   REFUSED, not silently honoured.
  --policy P       Policy to declare on the new home: live (default) or
                   frozen. A home that is ALREADY frozen is never touched.
  --print-env      Print the launch environment as `export` lines and exit.
                   Bootstraps first if needed. Safe to `eval`.
  --force          Re-run the steps on an existing live home. Never applies
                   to a frozen one, and never re-clones over an existing
                   store.
  --quiet          Say nothing at all on a successful run. The log is still
                   written; failures are still reported.
  --verbose        Put the whole log on stderr as it happens, instead of the
                   five-line summary. Nothing is withheld either way — a quiet
                   run names the log file that holds all of it.
  --onboard        When the finished home has NO skills, run
                   `skill-manager onboard --skip-gateway` on it instead of
                   refusing. Only legal for a MAIN working tree: onboarding a
                   WORKTREE home would give it units its project home never had,
                   and every one of those blocks teardown (issue #50).
  --onboard-gateway  With --onboard, also start the gateway. Off by default
                   because the gateway is a contended singleton
                   (skill-manager#132) and a bootstrap is not the place to
                   contend for it.
  --allow-empty    Accept a home with zero skills. Downgrades the refusal to a
                   warning; the home is still reported as EMPTY, never as
                   verified.
  --no-project     Do not run the `sync --skip-mcp` that projects this home's
                   skills into its agent homes. The home will hold skills that
                   no agent launched here can read; combine with
                   --allow-unprojected or the run refuses.
  --allow-unprojected  Accept a home whose skills are not reachable from its
                   agent homes. Downgrades the refusal to a warning; the home is
                   never reported as verified.

On success stderr carries five lines and nothing else: home, projected,
verified, launch, log. On failure it carries a bounded tail of the log and the
log's path. Stdout is reserved for --print-env.

Exit codes: 0 ok - 1 usage/setup error - 5 the home has no skills
            6 the home's skills are not projected into its agent homes

# --------------------------------------------------------- what this run SAYS
#
# Measured before this change, on a successful bootstrap: 76 lines / 12.2 KB, of
# which two thirds were caveats about dangling shims plus a remedy whose own text
# said it did not repair the thing it named. An agent reading that pays ~3.1k
# tokens per onboarding, and pays it on the run where nothing went wrong.
#
# The shape is the one `scripts/wt` already proved (123-line banner -> 5 lines of
# stdout), applied to this script's stderr:
#
#   THE DETAIL GOES TO A LOG FILE, AND THE LOG FILE IS NAMED IN THE OUTPUT.
#   Nothing is withheld — `log:` is one of the five lines, and everything that
#   used to be printed is in it, in order, including every byte the CLI wrote.
#
#   THE EVIDENCE STAYS ON THE CONSOLE. `projected: N of M into each of …` and
#   `verified: N skill(s) servable …` exist so that a claim about this home can be
#   CHECKED without running anything else; demoting them would turn the report
#   back into an assertion. They are the reason `--quiet` is a separate flag from
#   the log: quiet is for `wt`, which prints its own contract.
#
#   A FAILURE STILL PRINTS. A bounded tail of the log, plus its path. See
#   LOG_TAIL below for the bound and why it is the tail.
#
# The mechanism is one redirection rather than a rewrite of every call site: fd 2
# becomes the log, so every existing `>&2` — this script's prose, its refusals,
# and the output of every CLI child it runs — lands there without a second
# spelling. fd 3 is the operator's real stderr, and `out` is the only thing that
# writes to it on a successful run.
#
# The template ENDS in the X's and the suffix is added afterwards: BSD mktemp
# only substitutes a trailing run of them, so `…-XXXXXX.log` is not a template at
# all — it is a filename, the same one for every run on the machine, and two
# concurrent bootstraps would interleave into it. Measured here, on the first
# run: the line printed was literally `…/bootstrap-home-XXXXXX.log`.

# "source home does not exist" at 12 lines, and the next longest — the exit-5
# empty-home refusals — are 9; 20 carries every one of them whole, with room for
# the line or two of context above it, and still cuts a 151-line CLI transcript.
#
# Printing only the path was considered and rejected: it is strictly worse than

# ------------------------------------------- what this run leaves in the tree
#
# git-integration-skill: onboarding created `<root>/.claude.json` — a file no
# documented ignore rule covers, because the documented rules are `/.claude/`,
# `/.codex/`, `/.gemini/`, `/.skill-manager/` and `/.claude/` does not match
# `/.claude.json`. The next command an operator runs is `wt new`, which asserts
# a clean tree, and it refused: `working tree is not clean`. Onboarding a repo
# made the repo unusable by the next step of onboarding it.
#
# WHAT to ignore is measured, never enumerated: LIST THE UNTRACKED TOP-LEVEL
# ENTRIES BEFORE ANY WORK, LIST THEM AGAIN AFTER, AND IGNORE THE DIFFERENCE.
# Whatever this run created is by construction this run's to account for,
# whatever it is called. A hardcoded list of the four documented rules is the
# failure this exists to catch, and a fifth entry would be the same enumeration
# one entry longer — it fails again the moment the product moves or renames the
# file. Which it did, in the direction that helps: as of skill-manager 0.20.0
# the MCP registration is written to `<root>/.claude/.claude.json` (with a
# `.claude.json.lock` beside it), both already covered by `/.claude/`, so a
# 0.20.0 bootstrap + install now leaves only `.skill-manager/`, `.claude/`,
# `.codex/` and `.gemini/` at the root. That is a measurement, not a guarantee,
# and it is exactly why nothing here enumerates: the next thing the product
# writes at a checkout root will be reported by this code and by no list.
#
# THE RULE GOES IN `$GIT_COMMON_DIR/info/exclude`, NOT IN `.gitignore`. Both
# candidates were built and measured; this is the one that ships, and the reason
# is not that it is tidier:
#
#   * `.gitignore` IS TRACKED. Appending to it makes the tree dirty a different
#     way — one modified file instead of one untracked one — and `wt new`
#     refuses either way. To be the mechanism it would have to be COMMITTED,
#     which is a far larger authority than "create a directory": it lands on
#     whatever branch happens to be checked out, has no quiet undo, and would
#     sweep up whatever else the operator had in that file. The alternative —
#     REFUSING until someone commits the rules — was implemented and measured,
#     and the cost decided it: A REPO NOBODY CAN COMMIT TO COULD NOT GET A HOME.
#     Read-only checkouts, CI, and vendored third-party constituents are not
#     edge cases in an integration repo, they are most of it. (Measured on the
#     way past: three selftest fixtures carried no `.gitignore` at all, and the
#     suite went to 71 passed / 44 failed until each was onboarded by hand.
#     That is what a real user hits on first contact.)
#   * the exclude file is per-clone and appears in no diff, so onboarding a repo
#     never requires a commit TO that repo.
#   * it is read from the COMMON dir, so one write covers the main tree and
#     every linked worktree, and the `/`-anchored rules apply at each worktree
#     root separately — which is what is wanted, since every worktree gets its
#     own home.
#
# THE COST, said plainly here and in references/skill-homes.md rather than
# discovered: THIS RULE IS INVISIBLE TO EVERY OTHER CLONE. It makes the checkout
# in hand clean and does nothing for a teammate, a CI job, or a fresh clone —
# and because it leaves a tree exactly as clean as a `.gitignore` rule does,
# `git status` cannot tell the two apart and a green "the tree is clean" check
# says nothing about which one did it. `git check-ignore -v` names the source,
# and that is what selftest.sh asserts. A repo whose contributors all want it
# clean should still commit the rules to a tracked `.gitignore`; that is a
# RECOMMENDATION, never a precondition, and this script does not depend on it.

# Top-level untracked entries, one per line, directories with a trailing slash.
# Deliberately depth-1: the unit of ignoring here is "a thing the home
# machinery put at the root", never a file inside the operator's own new

# Which skill-manager runs this. Same first rule as

#
# The capability probe exists because `home` is newer than the released CLI:
# without it a stale skill-manager is picked and fails deep inside the
# sequence, after directories have already been created.
#
# The probe reads the help TEXT rather than the exit status alone, and that is
# still deliberate: the released 0.19.2 answers an unknown subcommand by
# printing top-level usage and exiting 0 (newer builds exit 2), so a
# status-only probe accepts a CLI with no `home` command at all.
#
# HBR-2: IT READ THE TEXT *INSTEAD OF* THE STATUS, AND THREW THE STATUS AWAY.
# The probe was one line:
#
#   cli_has_home() { "$1" home clone --help 2>&1 | grep -q -- '--to'; }
#
# In a pipeline the function's status is GREP's, so the candidate's own exit
# code never survived — 0, 2, 79 and 127 all arrived as "no `--to`", and the
# sole discriminator left was whether a string appeared. So every way of
# failing rendered as the same sentence:
#
#   on PATH: <other home>/bin/cli/skill-manager (too old — `home clone` is missing)
#
# about a CLI that was not old and does have `home clone`. It is another home's
# ENTRYPOINT, and it refused because SKILL_MANAGER_HOME named a third home —
# `pick_cli` runs before this script exports SKILL_MANAGER_HOME, so the probe
# runs under the CALLER's ambient home, which is the trigger. The signal was
# already there and already unique: the shim exits 79
# (LauncherShims.HOME_MISMATCH_EXIT_CODE), chosen so a caller could tell a
# refusal from the self-exec refusal at 78, and it collides with nothing this
# script sees. It was emitted and discarded.
#
# So the probe now returns a VERDICT and no pipeline hides the status.
CLI_HOME_MISMATCH_EXIT=79   # LauncherShims.HOME_MISMATCH_EXIT_CODE

# The home a candidate BINDS, or empty when it is not a home entrypoint.
#
# Structural, not textual, and it runs NOTHING. A generated entrypoint lives at
# <home>/bin/cli/skill-manager and derives its home as `../..` — so this reads
# the same two levels the shim itself reads and cannot drift from it. Deriving
# it instead of grepping for a marker also catches the pre-#61 PATH-searching
# shims, which carry no marker at all (see PATH_SHIM_MARKER below).
#
# WHY A TEXT TEST WHEN EXIT 79 IS RIGHT THERE: because the two fixes for this
# defect ship on opposite sides of a version skew. A CLI old enough to predate
# the refusal, or new enough to have been taught that `--help` names no home
# and so to answer it, both return 0 here — and neither is usable to bootstrap
# a DIFFERENT home while SKILL_MANAGER_HOME names a third one. This clause and
# the exit-code clause below cover each other; whichever build is installed,

# RE-MEASURED 2026-08-23, AND THE TRIGGER CHANGED WHILE THE CONSEQUENCE DID NOT.
# This comment used to say `home clone` skips venvs/, tools/, npm/ and cache/,
# "so any link INTO one of them arrives dangling". That is no longer true. A
# lazy clone (`lazy_artifacts = true`, the default for a project or worktree
# home) writes a regular-file COLD SHIM at such a path -- a 914-byte script that
# exits 86 naming `skill-manager build <id>` -- not a symlink. `find -type l`
# with `! -e` therefore finds NOTHING on a healthy lazy clone, and this function
# correctly returns empty there.
#
# What it still finds, and what `home verify` still refuses over, is a link that
# genuinely does not resolve. Measured both ways on one home: clean lazy clone
# -> "every reference ... resolves", exit 0; the same home plus one planted
# `bin/cli/fixture-dangling -> ../../venvs/fixture-missing/bin/tool` -> "1
# reference(s) ... do not resolve", exit 1. So the report below is not stale --
# its PREMISE was. The contract this sits inside is stated once, in
# ${SKILL_MANAGER_HOME:-$HOME/.skill-manager}/plugins/tla-spec-dev/skills/skt/references/derived-artifacts.md

# ------------------------------------------------------------- the CLI pin
#
# <home>/bin/cli/skill-manager decides which build every launch from this home
# runs: the generated launchers read it, and HomeDescriptor.resolveCli
# documents it as rule 3. Since issue #61 the launchers have NO PATH fallback
# at all, so a wrong or missing pin is not a downgrade, it is a home that
# cannot launch.
#
# THIS SCRIPT NO LONGER WRITES THAT FILE.
#
# It used to, and it was right to: `skill-manager home shims` wrote a
# PATH-RESOLVING shim, and PATH's skill-manager on this machine is the released
# 0.19.2 — which has no `exec` subcommand, so every generated launcher ended in
# `Unmatched arguments: 'exec'`. Homes bootstrapped through this script worked
# and homes provisioned by `home shims` alone did not, and because this script
# masked the difference for the whole 24-repo onboarding fan-out, nobody saw
# it.
#
# skill-manager fixed it (issue #61, commit e65962e): `home shims` now writes
# the absolute pin itself, derived from the build that is running it
# (RunningCli), with no PATH fallback. At that moment two writers of one file
# stopped being a redundancy and became a race with exactly one correct answer
# — and this script's predicate lost it. It decided whether to overwrite by
# grepping the slot for the literal words `home shims`, which the FIXED
# generated file also contains. Measured: 17 of 25 homes had a correct pin
# replaced with a pin to whatever `pick_cli` had chosen, and an 18th — written
# before this script marked its own output — was not repaired at all. A
# predicate that keys on prose cannot distinguish versions of the prose.
#
# So `ensure_cli_pin` VERIFIES, and delegates every repair to the one writer:
#
#   marker present   -> check the pinned target is executable, and STOP.
#   absent, or ours,
#   or a pre-#61
#   PATH shim        -> re-run `home shims`. Never write the body here.
#   anything else    -> someone else's tool. Leave it alone.

# The token LauncherShims.PIN_MARKER puts on line 2 of the generated
# entrypoint, existing precisely so a predicate has something stable to key on.
# Checked against the generated BYTES, not against the javadoc that names it:
# a predicate that matches nothing fails silently, and that is this function's
# entire failure history.
GENERATED_PIN_MARKER='skill-manager:cli-pin'

# The generated pin's assignment line is, verbatim,
#   cli="${SKILL_MANAGER_CLI:-<absolute path>}"
# Matched as a FIXED string and stripped with parameter expansion rather than
# parsed with a regex: `${`, `:-`, `}` and `$` are each metacharacters in some
# dialect of some grep or sed, and a pattern that quietly matches nothing here
# means the pin is never checked at all.
GENERATED_PIN_PREFIX='cli="${SKILL_MANAGER_CLI:-'

# What `home shims` generated BEFORE #61: a shim that searched PATH with its
# own directory filtered out. It carries no marker of its own — the marker
# above was added by the fix — so the search itself is the only thing that
# identifies it, and it is the shape most likely still sitting in an
# already-bootstrapped home on this machine.
PATH_SHIM_MARKER='command -v skill-manager'

# What THIS script wrote while it was still a writer, and (LEGACY) what an even
# older version wrote before it marked its own output. Both are stale by
# construction now: they pin whatever `pick_cli` chose at the time rather than
# the build `home shims` ran as, and neither is re-derived when the build
# moves.
#
# LEGACY_PIN_MARKER is kept deliberately. Without it `ensure_cli_pin` cannot
# recognise its own past output and takes the "someone else's tool" branch — so
# the homes most likely to carry a stale pin become the only ones it refuses to
# repair. That gap was measured once already (16 homes repaired by re-running
# this script, the 17th and oldest silently not), and dropping the marker while
# rewriting the function would re-open it for exactly those homes.
# THESE TWO STRINGS ARE NOT RENAMED WITH THE FILE, DELIBERATELY. They are not
# labels, they are RECOGNISERS of bytes already written into homes on disk by
# earlier runs of this script — back when it shipped in git-integration-repo.
# Renaming them to match the file's new unit would make `ensure_cli_pin` stop
# recognising its own past output and take the "someone else's tool" branch,
# which is exactly the gap measured above (16 homes repaired, the 17th and
# oldest silently not). The file moved; the bytes in existing homes did not.

# `home shims` writes the launchers AND the pin, and it REFUSES rather than
# guessing: RunningCli probes SKILL_MANAGER_CLI, the running process's own
# command, SKILL_MANAGER_INSTALL_DIR and the jar's own location, and when none
# of them answers it exits 127 having written NOTHING. That is the right
# behaviour — the PATH fallback is what #61 removed — but it means a caller
# that swallows the output reports a bare 127 for the one failure the CLI took
# care to explain.
#
# Every candidate `pick_cli` can return is a launcher that exports
# SKILL_MANAGER_INSTALL_DIR before it execs the JVM, because that is how each
# distribution finds its bundled gateway sources: a source checkout is
# `<repo>/skill-manager` and a release/Homebrew install is
# `<prefix>/bin/skill-manager`, and RunningCli probes both layouts. Verified on
# this machine — `pick_cli` resolves the integration parent's
# constituents/skill-manager/skill-manager, which exports the variable, and
# `home shims` pins it. What the probe cannot survive is a $CLI that is not a
# launcher at all (a bare `jbang SkillManager.java`, a wrapper that drops the
# variable). That is a configuration mistake rather than a defect, so it gets a
# diagnostic naming the fix instead of a 127 with no context.

# ------------------------------------------- the skills have to REACH an agent
#
# git-integration-skill: `home clone` copies the STORE. The agent homes —
# `<root>/.claude`, `<root>/.codex`, `<root>/.gemini` — live BESIDE the store, so
# they are not in the copy, and this script created them empty. Measured on a
# `wt new` worktree: rc 0, the full contract, `verified: 20 skill(s) servable`,
# and `ls -a <wt>/.claude` answering `.` `..` — no `skills/` directory at all.
# Every agent launched in that worktree saw zero skills.
#
# `skill-manager exec` documents `--no-reconcile` as "skip refreshing the home's
# agent symlinks", and the reconcile DOES run: it prints one line per missing
# projection, naming the exact destination and the command that would create it,
# and creates nothing. So the fact was available on stdout of every launch and
# nothing acted on it.
#
# `sync --skip-mcp` is that command. It is the product's own remedy, printed by
# the product, and running it here is one call rather than a second
# implementation of where a projection goes — which matters, because the
# destination is `<agent dir>/skills/<unit>` with a `default:<agent>:<unit>`
# ledger record beside it, and a hand-rolled symlink would be the link without
# the record.
#
# What it costs, measured: ~3s on a 1-unit home, ~8s on a 5-unit one, and NOTHING
# on a re-run, because the step is skipped when the projection is already
# complete. Only the first bootstrap of a home pays.
#
# What it must not do is INSTALL. On a worktree home, a unit the project home
# never had is a close-out blocker before any work exists (#50), and `sync`
# resolves declared dependencies. That cannot happen when the source home is
# complete — the copy already holds everything — so it is asserted rather than
# assumed: the unit set is compared across the call and any addition is named.

# `<agent dir>/skills` for every agent this home declares, read from the
# descriptor. Same source as the directories themselves, so this cannot check a

  # It used to say "and a clone always produces some". RETRACTED, re-measured
  # 2026-08-23: a lazy clone produces NONE -- it writes cold shims, which are
  # regular files that resolve -- so on a modern clone this branch is correctly
  # silent and `home verify` exits 0. The branch is kept because a genuinely
  # unresolvable link is still possible and is still refused (exit 1, measured).

  # Reported rather than fatal for a reason that also needs re-dating: the

  # --stale` instead, which is a different command and has not been measured

  # not fail an operator over a home-provisioning defect it cannot fix -- but do

#
# This spot printed nine lines telling the operator to run
# `<pinned env> skill-manager sync --force-scripts` to re-provision the shims a
# clone left dangling, and then — in its own text, three lines later — that it
# "does NOT recreate <home>/venvs, so a link INTO venvs/ stays dangling and
# `skill-manager home verify` keeps refusing this home". Measured AT THE TIME,
# and that is why the sentence was there: `home verify` rc=1 on
# `bin/cli/jinja2 -> ../../venvs/jinja2-cli/bin/jinja2` -> run the remedy (it
# completes) -> `home verify` rc=1 again, identical message, <home>/venvs still
# empty.
#
# THAT MEASUREMENT IS HISTORICAL. Do not restore the paragraph on the strength
# of it. Re-measured 2026-08-23 on a lazy clone: the same `bin/cli/jinja2` is a
# regular-file cold shim that exits 86 naming `skill-manager build
# 'cli-shim:pip/jinja2-cli[yaml]'`, `home verify` exits 0 on that home, and that
# build command DOES provision `venvs/jinja2-cli` and clear it. The deletion was
# right; its stated reason has expired.
#
# A remedy that its own paragraph says does not remedy is not detail, and moving
# it to the log would only make it cheaper to keep. What survives is the fact —
# `warning: N link(s) in this home do not resolve …`, one line, printed by
# verify() above with the links themselves in the log — and nothing that tells
# anyone to run a command that will not help.
#
# The other half of that paragraph warned the reader off the spelling
# `home clone` prints for itself, `SKILL_MANAGER_HOME=<home> skill-manager sync
# --force-scripts`, whose binding step writes the OPERATOR'S ~/.claude.json with
# the agent-home variables unset (skill-manager#145, measured: `ADDED claude
# (~/.claude.json)`). That warning is kept, in the log, beside the line it
# contradicts — which is where it is legible, since the line it contradicts is
# now in the log too. Every command this script prints anywhere still goes
# through `home_env_prefix`, which pins both axes; that is the property, and it
# is asserted in selftest.sh rather than restated here.

The home is a clone: cache/, tmp/, logs/, venvs/, tools/ and npm/ were not
copied, so a shim whose target lived under one of those arrived dangling.

\`home clone\` printed a remedy for that a few lines up. Do not run it as it
stands: it sets SKILL_MANAGER_HOME alone, and a sync with the agent-home
variables unset writes the OPERATOR'S ~/.claude.json, ~/.codex/config.toml and
~/.gemini/settings.json (skill-manager#145). It also does not recreate
<home>/venvs, so a link INTO venvs/ stays dangling and \`skill-manager home
verify\` keeps refusing this home whether you run it or not. That is a
skill-manager gap; only the tools those links name are affected.
