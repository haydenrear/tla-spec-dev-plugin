# Per-checkout Skill Manager homes

**This page and the scripts it documents belong to `git-issue-workflow`.** A home
is a fact about a CHECKOUT, and every repo has checkouts; only some repos have
constituents. It used to live in `git-integration-repo`, which meant an agent
working a plain repo — reading that skill's description and correctly concluding
it was irrelevant — never found it. The integration-repo sections below are still
here because an integration repo is one of the shapes a checkout comes in, not
because the mechanism is integration-specific.

An agent working a ticket installs, edits, syncs and binds skills. By default all
of that lands in the operator's global `~/.skill-manager`, which every other
agent and every other worktree is also using. Parallel tickets collide there, and
an improvement an agent makes to a skill has no defined route back to that
skill's own repo.

So each checkout gets its **own** home:

```
<checkout>/.skill-manager/        the home (a clone of an existing home)
<checkout>/.skill-manager/home.runtime.json    the launch descriptor
<checkout>/.skill-manager/home.policy.toml     live | frozen
<checkout>/.skill-manager/bin/launch/{claude,codex,gemini}   launcher shims
<checkout>/.claude  <checkout>/.codex  <checkout>/.gemini    agent homes
```

One script does this, for both the repo root and every worktree:

```bash
"$(for d in "${SKILL_MANAGER_HOME:-$HOME/.skill-manager}"/skills/git-issue-workflow "${SKILL_MANAGER_HOME:-$HOME/.skill-manager}"/plugins/*/skills/git-issue-workflow; do [ -d "$d" ] && { printf %s "$d"; break; }; done)/scripts/bootstrap-home.sh" --root <checkout>
```

**An agent does not need that path memorised, and does not need a copy of
anything.** `wt new` in a repository with no home yet exits 3 and prints the
line above with both paths already absolute; running it verbatim is the whole
onboarding. So no repo is *required* to carry a locator, and copying one in is
not a prerequisite for anything.

A repo *may* additionally carry `scripts/agent-home.sh`, purely so a human in
the checkout can type `scripts/agent-home.sh` instead of the long path. **This
skill ships that file**: copy
`$(for d in "${SKILL_MANAGER_HOME:-$HOME/.skill-manager}"/skills/git-issue-workflow "${SKILL_MANAGER_HOME:-$HOME/.skill-manager}"/plugins/*/skills/git-issue-workflow; do [ -d "$d" ] && { printf %s "$d"; break; }; done)/scripts/agent-home.sh`
into the target repo's own `scripts/` directory. It holds no policy — it finds
the `bootstrap-home.sh` above and `exec`s it with `--root <repo>`, so a copy of
it is never a copy of the ordering rules. It is a convenience, not a rung the
mechanism depends on; a consumer that never copies it loses nothing.

**Which copy it found is printed on every run**, because "the bootstrap ran" and
"the bootstrap you reviewed ran" are different facts. Measured, same fixture,
same command: the checkout's copy projected 18 of 18 skills into every agent
home, and `~/.skill-manager`'s copy — 33 KB, predating the projection work —
produced **empty agent homes** and exited 0. So the locator does not accept a
candidate because the file exists. It asks each one whether `--help` names
`--allow-unprojected`, the flag that arrived with projection support, skips the
ones that cannot answer, and **refuses** (naming every candidate and its
verdict) if none can. The remedy it prints is `skill-manager sync`, or
`INTEGRATION_BOOTSTRAP_HOME=<path>/scripts/bootstrap-home.sh`, which is to this
skill's *scripts* what `SKILL_MANAGER_CLI` is to the CLI: the only way to pin
which copy runs. Nothing else pins them — an installed unit's scripts come from
whichever home resolved it, and that home can be arbitrarily stale (measured
skew on one machine: checkout `941ec20`, `~/.skill-manager` `c5abdab`, project
home `24fe6e8`).

## Where the isolation actually comes from

`SKILL_MANAGER_HOME` alone is **not** enough, and assuming it is has cost this
epic real time:

- Skills load from Claude's config dir, so `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` (and
  `CLAUDE_HOME`, which carries the same value) must be redirected too. Both are
  emitted by the descriptor; `skill-manager exec` refuses a launch where they
  still resolve outside the home.
- `skill-script` CLI deps are generated shell scripts with a home's absolute
  path in the body. No variable redirects those, so the launch PATH puts this
  home's `bin/` first **and removes other homes' `bin/`**.

All of that lives in `skill-manager exec` / `LaunchEnv`. The generated shims are
thin wrappers over it. **Launch agents through the shims** (or through
`skill-manager exec`) and you inherit the whole contract; export variables by
hand and you get the part you remembered.

### It is a convention, and it is enforced by tests rather than by the kernel

Say what that is plainly: **env vars and PATH order**. Nothing in it *stops* a
process writing to `~/.skill-manager`, to another project's home, or to
`~/.ssh`. A determined — or merely surprising — process can write anywhere the
operator can. Every leak this epic fixed was a process writing where nothing
stopped it.

What keeps the convention from regressing is not a boundary, it is that the
recipe is written down **once** and something fails when a second copy appears:

- `test_graph/sources/lib/SmEnv.java` in `skill-manager` is the only place that
  puts `SKILL_MANAGER_HOME`, `SKILL_MANAGER_INSTALL_DIR`, `CLAUDE_HOME`,
  `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, `CODEX_HOME` or `GEMINI_HOME` into a child environment.
  `sources/sandbox/SandboxEnvContract.java` is the oracle that keeps it the only
  one: it fails if any other file writes one of those, and it fails if a file
  that spawns the CLI does not reach `SmEnv` through its own `//SOURCES`
  closure. It plants five synthetic nodes every run and requires the detector to
  flag three and clear two, because a scan reporting "no violations" is worth
  nothing until it has been shown to report one. Before that existed the recipe
  lived in prose and four disagreeing copies, and **50 of 105** CLI env sites
  passed neither the agent variables nor `HOME` — one of those projections
  turned up in a live agent's available-skills list. It is 0 now.
- `LaunchEnv.requireClaudeRedirected()`, called by `ExecCommand` **before any
  child process is created**, refuses a launch whose Claude config directory
  resolves outside the home root. Skills load from that directory, so an
  unredirected one is not a warning, it is the wrong home.

A `sandbox-exec` (Seatbelt) layer was built to make this a real kernel boundary,
and it was **removed** (`skill-manager` #60, closed as not-planned; commit
`5f8d61e`). Three reasons, none of them a defect in the code: it is macOS-only,
so the guarantee existed on one platform and every other got the convention
anyway; it fought the harnesses it was protecting, because `claude` and `codex`
each spawn their own tooling and each met the profile somewhere different, so
the failure mode was a mid-session `EPERM` from a process skill-manager did not
write and could not explain; and its cache redirection gave every home a private
copy of stores the operator already had (`~/.cache/uv` alone is 51 GB here, and
this machine carries 35 homes). If you are looking for `SKILL_MANAGER_SANDBOX`,
`launch.sb` or `home shims --sandbox`: they do not exist. Nothing in this repo
offers a kernel boundary, and an earlier version of this page said otherwise.

### What a per-home clone actually costs

The three-tier model — a home per repository, a home per ticket worktree — is
affordable because a clone is **copy-on-write**, not a copy. `Files.copy` with
`COPY_ATTRIBUTES` takes the JDK's `clonefile(2)` path on APFS and the
destination shares the source's blocks. Measured on this host by free-space
delta on a dedicated volume: a `home clone` of a 189 MB home consumes **7.22 MB
— 3.8%**. Do not check this with `du`; it attributes shared blocks to both files
and reported 197.1 MB against 7.14 MB real.

`cache/`, `tmp/`, `logs/`, `venvs/`, `tools/` and `npm/` are skipped on top of
that (see the clone caveat further down).

### Package caches are shared; install targets are not

A home does **not** get a private package cache, and the distinction is not
read-only versus writable — nothing here is read-only, and an agent can still
`uv pip install` (`skill-manager` commit `8fddd6e`, `pm/PackageCaches.java`):

| | category | |
|---|---|---|
| `~/.cache/uv`, `~/.npm`, the pip wheel cache | content-addressed | **shared** — an entry is named by the hash of what it holds, so two homes racing to populate one key write the same bytes |
| `<home>/venvs`, `<home>/bin/cli`, `<home>/npm/<skill>`, `<home>/pm/<tool>`, `<home>/cache` | install target | **per-home** — mutable, and two homes pointed at one are a `--force` away from pulling the interpreter out from under each other |

Sharing the store only pays if materializing out of it is cheap, so `UV_LINK_MODE`
is chosen per filesystem: `clone` (reflink) when the store and the home can
share blocks, `hardlink` on a same-filesystem pair that cannot reflink, `copy`
across filesystems. Guessing wrong degrades rather than breaks — uv falls back
to copy and warns. Measured counter-example for why this matters: three
skill-script venvs in one home held 48,258 files across 48,258 distinct inodes,
1.6 GB with zero sharing.

## When to bootstrap

| Checkout | When | How |
|---|---|---|
| Repo root (the main tree, where constituent `.git`s live) | Once, at onboarding, and again after the home is deleted | `scripts/agent-home.sh` |
| A ticket worktree | Automatically, by `new-change.sh`, before it returns | nothing to do |
| A worktree made by hand (`git worktree add`) | Immediately after creating it | `bootstrap-home.sh --root <wt>` |
| A **nested** integration repo (a constituent that is itself one) | At its own root, as its own checkout | `bootstrap-home.sh --root constituents/<nested>` |
| A constituent you are working in directly | Only if you run an agent from inside it rather than from the parent | `bootstrap-home.sh --root constituents/<name>` |

`bootstrap-home.sh` with no `--root` defaults to the **nearest enclosing git
toplevel**, which inside `constituents/deploy-helm` is deploy-helm — not the
integration parent. It used to walk up to `integration.toml` instead, so a bare
run from a constituent reported on (or created) the *parent's* home; usually the
parent's home already existed, so the run just said "already bootstrapped" and
the operator learned nothing.

A nested integration repo is not special-cased: it bootstraps at its own root
because that is the checkout an agent works in. Leaf-first ordering still
applies to *content* — a change to a leaf that the nested parent also contains
starts in the leaf, not in the duplicated nested path — and having a home per
checkout does not change that ordering at all.

## Which home a bootstrap clones FROM — and why it is not a choice

A worktree home and the project home it will be reconciled back into must be
**the same pair by construction**. `bootstrap-home.sh` and `close-change.sh`
both derive it from the checkout, through one function (`project_home` in
`lib.sh`):

| Checkout being bootstrapped | Cloned from | `close-change.sh --into` |
|---|---|---|
| A **linked worktree** | its project home — `<main working tree>/.skill-manager` | the same path |
| A **main working tree** | `$SKILL_MANAGER_HOME`, else `~/.skill-manager` | n/a — nothing closes it out |

`$SKILL_MANAGER_HOME` is **not** consulted for a worktree, deliberately. It used
to be the default for both tiers while `close-change.sh` defaulted `--into` to
`<repo-root>/.skill-manager`, and from a **bare shell** those name different
homes: measured, bootstrap cloned the operator's 845 MB global home into the
worktree and `home close-out` then blocked on **17 units before any work
existed**, printing a remedy that would have synced those global units *into*
the project home. The launch shims export `SKILL_MANAGER_HOME` and so never met
it; a human running the scripts by hand did (issue #50).

Two things therefore **refuse** rather than fall back:

- a worktree whose project has **no home yet** — bootstrap it at the project
  first, because a home cloned from anywhere else cannot be closed into the
  project;
- an explicit `--source` that is not the project home.

When the bootstrap refuses, `new-change.sh` **rolls the worktree and its branch
back**, so the operator's next command is the one the message names rather than
`worktree path already exists`.

`scripts/selftest.sh` proves both directions on a disposable fixture, from a
bare shell, against a decoy global home: it asserts by **unit name present /
absent** which home the worktree's copy came from, so a check that only looked
for the right unit could not pass a home that carried both. It also pins the
things that have no other coverage — that a ticket resolves to the same worktree
from a sibling worktree, that `--dry-run` from *inside* a worktree is answered
while a real removal from inside it refuses, that a refused bootstrap leaves no
worktree or branch behind, and that a remedy's conflicted-file list is not
mangled.

## Which `skill-manager` a home uses

`home clone`, `home shims`, `home policy`, `home describe` and `exec` are newer
than the released CLI, so `bootstrap-home.sh` probes for a build that has them:
`SKILL_MANAGER_CLI`, then `PATH`, then a `skill-manager` the checkout itself
ships, then one the **enclosing integration repo** ships. That last entry is
what lets a constituent home find a capable build at all: bootstrapping
`constituents/deploy-helm` searched only deploy-helm, which ships no CLI, so it
either refused or ran on a `SKILL_MANAGER_CLI` the caller exported by hand and
that nothing recorded. The epic build lives in the parent. If nothing answers
`home clone`, it refuses **before** creating anything and tells you why — a
half-bootstrapped worktree is worse than none.

### The pin at `<home>/bin/cli/skill-manager`

That slot decides which build every launch from the home runs. The generated
launchers read it and `HomeDescriptor.resolveCli` documents it as rule 3, and
since `skill-manager` issue #61 there is **no `PATH` fallback behind it** — the
launcher's last line is `exec "$cli" exec --home …` and the released 0.19.2 on
`PATH` has no `exec` subcommand, so a `PATH` branch could only ever produce
`Unmatched arguments: 'exec'`. A wrong or missing pin is therefore not a
downgrade, it is a home that cannot launch.

**`skill-manager home shims` writes it. `bootstrap-home.sh` does not.**

It used to, and that was right at the time: `home shims` wrote a
`PATH`-resolving shim, so homes bootstrapped through this script worked and
homes provisioned by `home shims` alone died at their last line — and because
this script masked the difference across a 24-repo onboarding fan-out, nobody
saw it. Commit `e65962e` fixed `home shims` to write the absolute pin itself,
derived from the build running it (`RunningCli`), and at that moment two writers
of one file stopped being a redundancy and became a race with one correct
answer.

This script's predicate lost that race. It decided whether to overwrite by
grepping the slot for the literal words `home shims` — which the **fixed**
generated file also contains. Measured: **17 of 25** homes had a correct pin
replaced by a pin to whatever `pick_cli` had chosen, and an 18th, written before
the script marked its own output, was not repaired at all. A predicate that keys
on prose cannot distinguish versions of the prose, which is why the fix
introduced a stable token — `skill-manager:cli-pin`, `LauncherShims.PIN_MARKER`,
on line 2 of the generated body.

So `ensure_cli_pin` **verifies, and delegates every repair to the one writer**:

| What is in the slot | What happens |
|---|---|
| The `skill-manager:cli-pin` marker | Read the pinned path, check it is executable, **stop**. The file is not this script's to rewrite. |
| Nothing | Re-run `home shims` |
| This script's own older pin (`git-integration-repo:cli-pin`, or the unmarked one before it) | Re-run `home shims` |
| A pre-#61 `PATH`-resolving shim (identified by its `command -v skill-manager`, since it carries no marker) | Re-run `home shims` |
| Anything else | Left alone — it could be a real CLI dep |

A pin whose target is **gone** is a refusal, not a repair: the script names the
missing path and the command that re-pins it (`home shims --home <store>`, run
from the build the home should use) and writes nothing. Substituting a CLI of
its own choosing is exactly what overwrote the 17.

This runs on an already-bootstrapped home without `--force`, because the
operator has no way to know the slot is wrong. A **frozen** home is never
written, here as everywhere else.

`home shims` itself **refuses rather than guessing**: `RunningCli` probes
`SKILL_MANAGER_CLI`, the running process's own command,
`SKILL_MANAGER_INSTALL_DIR` and the jar's location, and exits 127 having written
nothing when none answers. Every candidate `pick_cli` can return is a launcher
that exports `SKILL_MANAGER_INSTALL_DIR` before it execs the JVM, so the probe
succeeds — but `bootstrap-home.sh` prints that refusal verbatim rather than
reducing it to an exit code, because a `$CLI` that is not a launcher (a bare
`jbang SkillManager.java`) is a configuration mistake that deserves the CLI's
own diagnostic.

Pinning the slot does **not** retire `close-change.sh`'s help-**text** probe.
`pick_cli` still consults `PATH` when nothing else answers. From a bare shell
that is the released 0.19.2, so the exit-status trap is still reachable; from
inside an agent session it is *another home's pin*, because `skill-manager exec`
puts `<home>/bin/cli` first on the launch `PATH`.

#### The pin resolves itself through `$SKILL_MANAGER_CLI`, so do not point that at it

The generated body is `cli="${SKILL_MANAGER_CLI:-<absolute>}"` followed by
`exec "$cli" "$@"`. The variable is honoured **first** so a harness can redirect
the pin at a build of its own; the absolute default is what makes the pin a pin.
Naming the pin itself in that variable therefore throws away the target it
already knows and replaces it with a path to itself, and it re-execs **forever**
— no output, no exit, one process burning a core.

This is not hypothetical and it is not a corner: `pick_cli` in both
`bootstrap-home.sh` and `close-change.sh` *prefers* the home's own pin, and
`exec` puts a pin first on an agent session's `PATH`, so "the CLI I picked" and
"the CLI that must not be named in that variable" are usually the same file.
`close-change.sh` shipped exactly that pairing for one epic; see
[Teardown](#teardown-including-at-epic-close).

Rules for anything that invokes a chosen CLI:

- Decide **per candidate**. The variable is still what makes a remedy printed by
  a non-self-pinning launcher name a runnable path.
- **Scrub an inherited value**, do not merely refrain from setting one. The
  livelock does not care who exported it.
- Do not assume a candidate is safe because it came from `PATH`, and do not
  identify the hazard by path alone — inside an agent session the `PATH` answer
  is a pin belonging to a home the caller has never heard of. The reliable
  predicate is the candidate's own bytes: does it *expand*
  `$SKILL_MANAGER_CLI`?
- Do not rely on the CLI to defend itself. A guard added to the shim today is
  absent from every home already pinned by an older build, which is most of the
  homes a teardown will ever meet.

## The one ordering rule

```
clone the home  ->  point SKILL_MANAGER_HOME at the clone  ->  everything else
```

`install`, `sync`, `bind`, `upgrade` and `project resolve` all write into
whatever `SKILL_MANAGER_HOME` names, and `project resolve` additionally writes a
child-home record and a projection ledger into that store. Run any of them
before the local home exists and they mutate the operator's global home. That is
why `bootstrap-home.sh` clones as its first command, exports
`SKILL_MANAGER_HOME` as its second, and re-asserts the export before every
mutating step. Do not reproduce the sequence by hand.

Two consequences worth stating:

- **A cloned home is not a `project resolve` child home.** Both want the path
  `<root>/.skill-manager`. Resolving a root against that root's own home makes
  the home its own child: measured, it exits 0 and destroys nothing (unit
  materialization no-ops when source and destination are the same real path),
  but it records a child home whose parent and child are one directory and it
  isolates nothing. Pick the clone for a checkout an agent works in; use
  `project resolve` when the parent home lives somewhere else. Either way,
  never resolve before the local home exists — that is the case where the
  child-home record and the ledger land in the operator's global home.
- **A clone is not a full copy, and that is the design, not a shortfall.**
  `cache/`, `tmp/`, `logs/`, `venvs/`, `tools/` and `npm/` are skipped (they are
  re-derivable, and copying `tools/` costs 1.3 GB). **`pm/` is deliberately NOT
  in that list** — it holds the pinned package managers, and a home that cannot
  run `uv` cannot rebuild anything. What the clone does with the
  artifacts under those roots — and what you should do about it, which is
  usually nothing — **is stated once and is not repeated here:**
  `${SKILL_MANAGER_HOME:-$HOME/.skill-manager}/plugins/tla-spec-dev/skills/skt/references/derived-artifacts.md` (absent in a home that does not have the tla-spec-dev plugin installed). Read it before concluding a fresh worktree home is damaged.

  Two things this page still owns, both measured:
  - Run any `sync` with the **agent-home variables set**, not with
    `SKILL_MANAGER_HOME` alone. `sync` ends in a binding step, and with
    `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, `CODEX_HOME` and `GEMINI_HOME` unset that step writes
    the operator's `~/.claude.json`, `~/.codex/config.toml` and
    `~/.gemini/settings.json` (`ADDED claude (~/.claude.json)` —
    skill-manager#145). `bootstrap-home.sh` prints the safe spelling; the line
    `home clone` itself prints is the unsafe one.
  - **This page used to say `home verify` refuses a clone until those links are
    re-provisioned, and that `sync` could not do it — "a skill-manager gap".
    RETRACTED: re-measured 2026-08-23, a fresh ticket-worktree clone passes
    `skill-manager home verify` (exit 0) untouched.** The claim is left here as
    a correction so nobody restores it from memory. Why it is no longer true,
    and what the states actually are, is the artifact page above — this bullet
    deliberately does not reproduce its details. **Do not chase `home verify` to
    a green it already has.**

    A link that *genuinely* does not resolve is a different thing and **is**
    still refused (exit 1, measured the same day) — see the next bullet.

- **A clone of an empty home is an empty home** (git-integration-skill#10).
  Cloning copies units; it never *installs* any. A source home holding no skills
  therefore yields a perfectly well-formed home — right descriptor, right policy,
  working shims, happy `exec --print-env` — that serves an agent **zero skills**.
  The step that installs the bundled ones is `skill-manager onboard`, and it is
  not part of the clone.

  `bootstrap-home.sh` **refuses** such a home (exit `5`) rather than reporting it
  verified, and names `onboard`. It refuses rather than running it because
  `onboard` clones from github and touches the gateway, which is a contended
  singleton (skill-manager#132) — too expensive to attach to the most repeated
  command in this repo. Pass `--onboard` to have it run
  `onboard --skip-gateway` for you, `--onboard-gateway` to include the gateway,
  or `--allow-empty` to accept an empty home deliberately.

  For a **worktree** the remedy is always the *project* home, and `--onboard` is
  refused outright there: a worktree home is a copy of the project home and
  `close-change.sh` reconciles it back into that same home, so units installed
  into the copy are units the project never had — every one of them a teardown
  blocker before any work exists (issue #50).

- **A home full of skills is not a home an agent can read them from.** The store
  is `<home>/skills/`. *No agent reads it.* An agent reads
  `<root>/.claude/skills/<unit>` and its `.codex` / `.gemini` siblings, which are
  symlinks into the store, recorded in `installed/<unit>.projections.json` as
  `default:<agent>:<unit>` bindings.

  `home clone` copies the **store**. The agent homes live *beside* it, so they
  are not in the copy — and a freshly cloned worktree home therefore has a full
  store and three empty agent directories. Measured: `wt new`, exit 0, full
  contract, `verified: 20 skill(s) servable`, and `ls -a <wt>/.claude` answering
  `.` and `..`. Every agent launched in that worktree saw **zero** skills.
  `skill-manager exec` reports it on every launch — one `! reconcile: no
  skill-manager projection for <u> on <agent> at <path>` line per missing
  link — and creates nothing.

  `bootstrap-home.sh` now fixes it, and the order it fixes it in matters:

  1. **From the home's own ledger.** `home clone` copies
     `installed/<unit>.projections.json` *and re-anchors it*, so a fresh
     worktree home already declares the right destination under the right root.
     The records are correct; only the symlinks are missing. Materializing them
     is instant, offline, and touches no unit content.
  2. **`sync --skip-mcp`, only for what the ledger cannot answer** — a unit with
     no binding record at all, which is what a scaffolded or hand-seeded home
     has.

  That order is not a preference. `sync` refreshes unit *content*: measured on a
  worktree whose home was a correct copy of a complete project home, projecting
  through `sync` left `skills/<unit>/.git/index` differing from the project
  home's and `home close-out` then **refused the teardown** — issue #50
  reintroduced by the fix for this. With the ledger step first the same worktree
  needs no sync at all and closes cleanly.

  The run then reports `projected: N of M into each of .claude .codex .gemini`,
  and prints `verified:` **only when N = M**. A home an agent cannot read its
  skills from exits `6` and names every missing link plus the `sync --skip-mcp`
  that would create it; `--allow-unprojected` accepts one deliberately (still
  never as *verified*), and `--no-project` skips the projection step entirely.

## What a bootstrap prints, and where the rest of it went

A successful `bootstrap-home.sh` prints **five lines** on stderr:

```
home:      <root>/.skill-manager
projected: N of M into each of .claude .codex .gemini
verified:  N skill(s) servable — …
launch:    <root>/.skill-manager/bin/launch/claude
log:       /tmp/bootstrap-home-XXXXXX.log
```

It used to print 76 (measured on a real onboarding; 151 lines / 18.7 KB on the
selftest fixture), two thirds of them caveats about dangling shims plus a remedy
whose own text said it did not repair the thing it named. An agent paid ~3.1k
tokens for that on every onboarding — on the run where nothing went wrong.

Nothing was withheld, with one deliberate exception:

- **The detail is in the file `log:` names**, in order, including every byte the
  `skill-manager` CLI wrote. `--verbose` puts all of it back on stderr, live.
  `--quiet` prints nothing at all and is what `wt` passes.
- **The evidence stays on the console.** `projected:` and `verified:` exist so a
  claim about this home can be *checked* rather than believed; demoting them
  would turn the report back into an assertion. `selftest.sh` asserts the line
  budget and the presence of those lines *in the same check*, because "the output
  is short" is otherwise satisfied by a command that prints nothing.
- **A failure prints a bounded tail** of the log — 20 lines, which carries every
  refusal this script hand-writes whole — with the log's path on the line above
  it, so the failure's own last line stays last (`wt` quotes that line as its
  `error …:` reason when the child died without a `FAILED` key, and reads the
  log's path off that same first line to put on its `log:` line).
- **Deleted rather than demoted:** the paragraph that told you to run
  `sync --force-scripts` to re-provision the links a clone left dangling. Its own
  next sentence said the command "does NOT recreate `<home>/venvs`, so a link
  INTO `venvs/` stays dangling and `skill-manager home verify` keeps refusing
  this home" — measured at the time: `home verify` rc=1 → run the remedy → rc=1,
  identical message, `venvs/` still empty. What survives is the *fact*, one
  counted line: `warning: N link(s) in this home do not resolve …`, with the
  links themselves in the log.

  **Re-dated 2026-08-23, same correction as the clone bullet above: that
  remaining `keeps refusing` clause is stale too**, because a lazy clone no
  longer produces the link it is about. The `warning: N link(s) …` line is still
  real and still worth acting on — it now reports only references that
  *genuinely* do not resolve, which `home verify` does still refuse over (exit 1,
  measured). Telling that apart from the ordinary unbuilt state is the artifact
  page above; this page does not restate the distinction.

  `scripts/bootstrap-home.sh` and `scripts/selftest.sh` carried the same
  retracted premise in comments and were corrected in the same change — grep
  them for `RE-MEASURED 2026-08-23` if you are auditing this.

`new-change.sh` does the same thing: the contract on stdout, and one line on
stderr naming a log that holds its own narration **and** the bootstrap's.

## The first launch is gated on change awareness (exit 8)

A bootstrapped home is not the same thing as a home you can launch from. There
is one more gate, it belongs to `skill-manager` rather than to these scripts,
and **it is the first thing an operator meets after `new-change.sh` returns**.

### What it is for

An agent reads a skill, then works for twenty minutes on the strength of it. A
sync, a pull, or a fresh clone replaces that skill underneath it. Nothing fails
and nothing warns, and the agent keeps following instructions that no longer
exist. The only boundary at which that can still be said out loud is between
"the home changed" and "something starts using the home" — which is a launch. So
a change to a home's units is recorded, and the next launch **refuses** until
somebody has read it.

### The operator-visible contract

- The refusal is **exit 8**, before anything is spawned, with a report of what
  moved. A gate that fired after the launch would have already failed to gate.
- Bare `home drift` prints the pending change; `home drift --ack` clears it and
  the next launch proceeds. `--ack-drift` on a single `skill-manager exec`
  acknowledges in passing. Run them through the home's own
  `bin/cli/skill-manager`, not a bare `skill-manager` — same reason every remedy
  on this page names a resolved path.
- Acknowledgement is the **only** thing that retires it. Re-recording a digest
  does not: the record is a fact about a change that happened, not a statement
  about whether the home is currently self-consistent.
- The launcher shims (`bin/launch/{claude,codex,gemini}`) take the gated path,
  deliberately. `bootstrap-home.sh`'s own internal `exec` calls pass
  `--ack-drift`, so **the bootstrap verifying a home cannot tell you whether the
  operator's next command will be refused**.

### When a freshly provisioned worktree hits it

Measured on a disposable fixture: a worktree cloned from a project home whose
content had moved since that home last recorded a digest comes up with a pending
record, and `skill-manager exec --home <wt>/.skill-manager -- …` exits 8 with
`refusing to launch: … changed and the change has not been read.` Cloned from a
home whose digest was current, the same sequence exits 0.

"Content moved since the last recorded digest" is the ordinary state of a home
anyone is working in, so **expect the gate on a new worktree and do not read it
as a broken bootstrap**. Do not, however, encode "always" into a checklist: the
gate is a function of the source home's recorded state, both outcomes are
correct, and the exact conditions are `skill-manager`'s to change. Read the
report, acknowledge it, launch.

## `propagate.sh` and skill push-back are different flows

Confusing them loses work. They move different things in different directions.

| | `propagate.sh` | Skill push-back |
|---|---|---|
| What moves | A **parent** change: the diff you committed to the integration feature branch | A **skill** change: an edit an agent made to a unit inside its own home |
| From | The integration repo's merged feature branch | `<checkout>/.skill-manager/skills/<unit>/` |
| To | Each affected constituent's own repo: `feature/<TICKET>` + MR + one tracking issue | That skill's own repo, trunk-style, via `skill-manager project sync` (see the skill-manager skill and the skt plugin's unit-authoring skill) |
| Trigger | You merged a cross-repo change | An agent improved a skill while using it |
| Ignores the other's state | Yes — it fans out the parent diff and knows nothing about homes | Yes — it pushes a unit and knows nothing about the parent branch |

A skill's files inside a home are **not** part of the parent diff: the home is
gitignored, so `git add -A` in the worktree never sees them and `propagate.sh`
can never carry them. If an agent edits a skill in its home and you only run
`propagate.sh`, the edit is not published anywhere — and `git worktree remove`
then deletes it. **Push back before teardown.** `close-change.sh` enforces the
first, weaker half of that (the edit reaches the *project home*) and will not
let a bare removal skip it; getting the edit to the skill's own repo is still
this push-back flow, and still yours to run.

**And it now says so at the moment it matters.** A successful close prints a
`HOME-WORK` key naming the project home the work reached, and `wt close` carries
it onto its one line as `push skill edits from there`. That is why it is printed
at teardown rather than documented only here: the teardown is exactly when the
obligation becomes invisible — the worktree home is deleted, the loss appears in
no diff, and until this key existed nothing in the workflow mentioned it
(git-integration-skill#8). Note the direction too: push from the **main
checkout**. From a worktree the skill's upstream is the wrong target, because
the copy of the skill that holds the edit lives in the home being removed.

The reverse mistake is just as bad: a skill lives in its own repo, so editing
its copy under `constituents/<skill>/` and propagating that is the *parent*
flow, and it is the right one when you are changing the skill as a constituent
of this repo. Decide which artifact you changed — a repo's files, or a unit
inside a home — and use the matching flow.

## Policy: `live` and `frozen`

`bootstrap-home.sh` declares `live` by default: the home may be synced,
upgraded, and pushed back from. `--policy frozen` declares the opposite, for a
home whose contents are evidence (an experiment run, a bisect checkpoint).

A home that is **already frozen is never modified** — not re-shimmed, not
re-described, not re-baselined — and `bootstrap-home.sh` reports the skip
instead of "repairing" it. Clone a frozen home to get a live copy; the original
stays as it was.

## Teardown, including at epic close

Tear a worktree down with `close-change.sh`, never with a bare
`git worktree remove`:

```bash
# The gate runs BEFORE anything is deleted.
"$(for d in "${SKILL_MANAGER_HOME:-$HOME/.skill-manager}"/skills/git-issue-workflow "${SKILL_MANAGER_HOME:-$HOME/.skill-manager}"/plugins/*/skills/git-issue-workflow; do [ -d "$d" ] && { printf %s "$d"; break; }; done)/scripts/close-change.sh" TICKET-123

# At epic close, list what is left and close each one deliberately.
git -C <repo-root> worktree list
```

`close-change.sh` runs

```bash
skill-manager home close-out --home <wt>/.skill-manager \
                             --into <main-working-tree>/.skill-manager --json
```

`--into` is the project home the worktree's own home was **cloned from** — the
main working tree's, resolved by the same `project_home` helper
`bootstrap-home.sh` uses, so where the operator happens to be standing cannot
change the answer. It used to be `<checkout_root>/.skill-manager`, i.e. `$PWD`'s
nearest git toplevel, which from inside a sibling worktree named *that*
worktree's home.

Every remedy names a **resolved CLI path**, not a bare `skill-manager`. A bare
`skill-manager` on a machine with an older release first on PATH exits 2 for the
operator who copy-pastes it, and that is the machine this was found on.

The substitution happens in **one** place — `HomeCloseOut` builds the string and
names the CLI through `HomeDescriptor.resolveCli`, so `--json` and
`home close-out`'s own human output say the same thing. `close-change.sh`
renders the remedy verbatim and contributes only the *environment* that
resolution runs in.

It used to rewrite the string with a regex instead, and that was wrong twice: it
fixed only the `--json` consumer, and its token boundary matched inside
`skill-manager.toml` — the manifest every unit has, so the most likely conflicted
file there is — turning the operator's conflict list into a path in a different
repository. `scripts/selftest.sh` now asserts the remedy's **tail**, not just its
first token.

#### That environment is decided per candidate, and this is where it bit

`resolveCli`'s rules are, in order: `$SKILL_MANAGER_CLI`; the running process's
own command, when it looks like a launcher (a jbang/JVM process does not);
`<store>/bin/cli/skill-manager`; then a bare `skill-manager` off `PATH`. So when
`pick_cli` answers with a checkout's or the integration parent's launcher, the
export is what keeps a remedy off that last rule — and a bare `skill-manager`
here is the released 0.19.2, which exits 2 for whoever copy-pastes it.

For a while this page said the export *was* the script's contribution, full
stop. That stopped being true the moment `home shims` began writing a pin that
honours the same variable: `pick_cli`'s **preferred** candidate is the home's
own pin, and

```bash
SKILL_MANAGER_CLI="$CLI" "$CLI" home close-out …      # WRONG when $CLI is a pin
```

tells that pin to exec itself, forever. Measured on the epic #2 pilot: 7:03 of
CPU over 13:06 of wall clock from one teardown, silently — a teardown that hangs
is indistinguishable from a teardown that is slow, which on a fan-out means it
is indistinguishable from progress.

Neither change was wrong on its own. `home shims` was right to take ownership of
the pin; the script was simply still exporting from the era when it owned the
pin. They only met at the moment the pin started honouring the variable.

So `close-change.sh` now exports **only** to a candidate that does not resolve
itself through `$SKILL_MANAGER_CLI`, scrubs an inherited value for one that
does, and applies the same rule to its capability *probes* — with the variable
already set in an agent's environment, the hang landed inside `pick_cli`, before
the script had printed which CLI it was even trying. See
[the pin section](#the-pin-resolves-itself-through-skill_manager_cli-so-do-not-point-that-at-it)
for the predicate and why it reads the candidate's bytes rather than its path.

`selftest.sh` covers it under a hard time bound, because the regression's
signature is silence: an unbounded check against it does not go red, it goes
away. That section is also the only one that runs with `SKILL_MANAGER_CLI`
**unset** — with it set, `pick_cli` returns it from the first branch and a home's
own pin is never reached, which is how 26 green checks sat on top of this.

and **refuses to remove the worktree** (exit 4) while that verdict is non-zero,
printing every blocking unit and the exact command that clears it. Run the
remedy, re-run the script, and the removal proceeds.

### Project plugin lifecycle callback

A clean home does not prove external state has been released. A plugin that
owns worktree-lifetime state may install one executable in the project home:

```text
<project-home>/plugins/<plugin>/lifecycle/worktree-pre-remove
```

`close-change.sh` discovers those executables from the **project home**, in
stable bytewise plugin-name order. That location is intentional: it survives
the worktree removal, covers a `--no-home` worktree, and is the destination the
home gate has already reconciled. It invokes the executable as:

```bash
worktree-pre-remove check \
  --worktree <absolute-worktree> \
  --project-root <absolute-main-checkout> \
  --project-home <absolute-project-home> \
  --worktree-home <absolute-worktree-home>

worktree-pre-remove release <same flags>
```

`check` is read-only and runs on `--dry-run`. `release` runs only after the
home gate and every local removal precondition have passed, immediately before
`git worktree remove`. The callback locates its own config beneath
`--project-home`; this generic lifecycle does not interpret plugin data.

Each callback is bounded to 30 seconds and its diagnostic streams to 16 KiB.
A non-zero exit or timeout refuses with exit 4 and preserves the worktree.
`--force` does not bypass this refusal: that flag names a deliberate discard of
home bytes, while an unreleased external binding is still live state. There is
an unavoidable narrow `release` → `git worktree remove` failure window; putting
release after every other local check is the smallest honest local transaction.

Why a script rather than a rule: `git worktree remove` succeeds with a home
inside it because the home is ignored, not untracked — which is also why the
ignore rules matter. It deletes the home **without asking**, and it succeeds
exactly as quietly whether the home held a week of skill edits or nothing.
Because the home is gitignored, the loss shows up in no diff, so "push back
before teardown" was a discipline that failed silently the first time anyone
forgot. The gate makes it a mechanism.

### The override, and why it exists

```bash
"$(for d in "${SKILL_MANAGER_HOME:-$HOME/.skill-manager}"/skills/git-issue-workflow "${SKILL_MANAGER_HOME:-$HOME/.skill-manager}"/plugins/*/skills/git-issue-workflow; do [ -d "$d" ] && { printf %s "$d"; break; }; done)/scripts/close-change.sh" TICKET-123 --force
```

`--force` still runs the gate and still prints the blockers; it only declines to
stop, and it says plainly that the work is being discarded. It exists because a
gate with no escape hatch does not stop the operator who genuinely wants to
throw a spike away — it routes them to `rm -rf` or `git worktree remove --force`
by hand, which skips this check *and* every other one. A named, loud override is
safer than an improvised one. It does not override a project plugin lifecycle
callback failure.

### How it degrades

The rule is: proceed only when the gate has actually established there is
nothing to lose.

| Situation | What close-change.sh does | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Worktree has **no home** (`--no-home`) | Removes it, saying the gate was skipped | Absence of a home really is proof there is no home-resident work |
| **No `skill-manager` with `close-out`** on `SKILL_MANAGER_CLI`, the home's `bin/cli`, the checkout, the enclosing integration repo, or PATH | **Refuses** | Absence of the tool is absence of *proof*, which is not the same thing. A gate that opens when it cannot check is not a gate |
| **Project home missing** (`--into` does not exist) | **Refuses** | The work has nowhere to go and there is nothing to compare against |
| Gate reports blockers | **Refuses**, printing each remedy | The case the gate exists for |
| Project plugin lifecycle callback fails or times out | **Refuses even with `--force`** | External state was not proven released; deleting local bytes cannot repair that |

The capability probe reads the CLI's help **text**, not its exit status, for the
same measured reason `bootstrap-home.sh` does: the released 0.19.2 answers
`home close-out --help` by printing top-level usage and **exiting 0**. A
status-only probe would accept a CLI with no `close-out` at all and the teardown
would sail past a gate that never ran.

### Reconciling is not publishing

The gate's remedy (`home sync … --merge`) moves the work into the **project
home**, which is what stops the teardown destroying it. That is not the same as
getting the edit back to the skill's own repository — for that, see the
push-back flow in the table above. Clearing the gate makes the edit survive the
worktree; it does not make it survive the machine.

The global `~/.skill-manager` is never a teardown target. Nothing in this flow
writes it; `bootstrap-home.sh` refuses outright if a target home would resolve
to it.

## Ignoring the homes

### What actually keeps the tree clean

**`bootstrap-home.sh` writes a per-checkout rule into `$GIT_COMMON_DIR/info/exclude`.**
That is the mechanism. It is not the `.gitignore` list below, and for a long time
this page said it was.

The script does not work from a list. It records the untracked top-level entries
before it does anything, records them again afterwards, and excludes the
difference — plus any untracked entry whose name the home machinery owns
(`.claude*`, `.codex*`, `.gemini*`, `.skill-manager*`, read from the home's own
descriptor, never from a literal list in the script). Whatever a run creates is
that run's to account for, **whatever it is called**. The second rule is what
covers the ordinary re-run, where an earlier `install` / `sync` /
`project resolve` left a file behind before the script started.

It goes in the exclude file rather than in `.gitignore` because `.gitignore` is
**tracked**: appending to it makes the tree dirty a different way — one modified
file instead of one untracked one — and `wt new` refuses either way until someone
commits it. Making the script commit was built and measured, and the cost decided
against it: **a repo nobody can commit to could not get a home.** Read-only
checkouts, CI, and vendored third-party constituents are not edge cases in an
integration repo, they are most of it. (Measured on the way past: three
`selftest.sh` fixtures carried no `.gitignore` at all, and the suite went to
71 passed / 44 failed until each was onboarded by hand. That is first contact for
a real user.)

Reading the exclude file from the **common** dir means one write covers the main
tree and every linked worktree, and the `/`-anchored rules apply at each worktree
root separately — which is what is wanted, since every worktree gets its own home.

### The cost, said out loud

**A rule in `info/exclude` is invisible to everyone else.** It makes the checkout
in hand clean and does nothing for a teammate, a CI job, or a fresh clone — they
all still see `?? .skill-manager` and friends. It also lives where no review will
ever see it.

And because it leaves a tree *exactly* as clean as a `.gitignore` rule does,
`git status` cannot tell the two apart. Only `git check-ignore -v` names the
source, which is why `selftest.sh` asserts the source by name rather than
asserting "clean" — a check that only asserted cleanliness would pass under
either mechanism and prove nothing about which one ran.

### Recommended, not required: commit the rules too

A repo whose contributors all want a clean tree should **also** carry these in a
tracked `.gitignore`. Put them at the **parent root** — never in a file inside a
constituent (`INTEGRATION.md` rule 2):

```gitignore
/.skill-manager/
/.claude/
/.claude.json
/.codex/
/.gemini/
constituents/*/.skill-manager/
constituents/*/.claude/
constituents/*/.claude.json
constituents/*/.codex/
constituents/*/.gemini/
```

This is a **recommendation**. Nothing depends on it: `bootstrap-home.sh` does not
read this list, does not check it, and does not refuse without it. The benefit is
that a fresh clone is clean *before* anyone runs a bootstrap, and that the rule is
visible in review. When a rule here already covers a path, the bootstrap adds
nothing for it — git never reports an ignored path as untracked, so it never
reaches the exclude loop, and the two mechanisms compose rather than duplicate.

`/.claude.json` is in the list because `/.claude/` does not match it, and because
skill-manager builds **before 0.20.0** wrote claude's MCP registration to
`<root>/.claude.json`, beside the agent directory rather than inside it — which
left `?? .claude.json` in `git status` and made `wt new` refuse a freshly
onboarded repo. **That is fixed in the product.** Measured against
`skill-manager 0.20.0+g651691a`: the registration goes to
`<root>/.claude/.claude.json` (with a `.claude.json.lock` beside it), both already
covered by `/.claude/`, and a bootstrap + install now leaves only
`.skill-manager/`, `.claude/`, `.codex/` and `.gemini/` at a checkout root. The
rule is kept because older builds are still in the field and it costs nothing —
not because the defect is current.

That measurement is also the reason none of this is enumerated anywhere: the list
was right until the product moved the file, and it will be wrong again the next
time something new appears at a checkout root. The bootstrap will report that one;
a list will not.

If you do add them, **prove them** — a constituent's own `.gitignore` is more
specific than the root's and a negated rule in it wins:

```bash
git check-ignore -v .skill-manager/home.runtime.json
for d in constituents/*/; do git check-ignore -v "$d.skill-manager/x" || echo "NOT IGNORED: $d"; done
```

Every path must be reported as ignored. **Read which file `-v` names**, because
that is the difference between a rule the repo carries and a rule only this clone
has: `.gitignore` (or a constituent's own, which just means it already agrees)
means everyone gets it; `.git/info/exclude` means the bootstrap put it there and
nobody else has it. What must never happen is a path reported as not ignored, or
a home showing up in `git status`: committing a home would put another machine's
absolute paths, and a copy of every installed unit, into the parent repo.

**These rules cover a home, not a worktree.** A ticket worktree of a nested
integration repo or of a constituent is a whole checkout, and no ignore rule in
the parent can safely name it: a glob matching
`constituents/meta-orchestrator-CO2` also matches `constituents/deploy-helm`.
Worse, the worktree's `.git` is a file, so a parent `git add -A` stages it as a
gitlink rather than as files. That is why `new-change.sh` puts such worktrees
**outside** the outermost integration repo instead — see
`references/worktrees.md`. Nothing needs adding to the parent's `.gitignore`
for it.

## Bootstrapping the repo that ships the bootstrap

An integration repo that contains the CLI or the skill implementing this
mechanism has a genuine circular dependency the first time: the worktree that
installs the hook must itself be created the old way (`git worktree add`) and
have its home bootstrapped by hand inside it. That is expected once, not a bug
to chase.

Two measured consequences worth knowing before you rely on the in-repo copy:

- **A parent worktree carries the parent's *committed snapshot* of a
  constituent**, not that constituent's current branch. On this repo the
  snapshot's `skill-manager` had no `home` command at all while the main tree's
  working copy did, so a worktree could not bootstrap from the repo's own CLI
  until the snapshot was refreshed. Pin `SKILL_MANAGER_CLI` in the meantime — at
  a real `skill-manager` **launcher**, never at a home's `bin/cli/skill-manager`
  shim, which resolves itself through that same variable and would exec itself
  forever.
- **`new-change.sh` requires a clean parent tree**, and a parent mid-epic is
  often dirty with constituent drift. Then the worktree is created by hand and
  `bootstrap-home.sh --root <wt>` run against it — the same two steps the hook
  performs, in the same order.

## Onboarding any integration repo

1. Onboard the repo the ordinary way (`references/onboarding.md`).
2. Add the ignore rules above to the parent root `.gitignore`, then verify with
   `git check-ignore -v`.
3. Write a `skill-project.toml` at the root declaring the units this repo's
   agents need. It is portable intent — the realized state is the home.
4. Give the main tree its home, once:
   `$(for d in "${SKILL_MANAGER_HOME:-$HOME/.skill-manager}"/skills/git-issue-workflow "${SKILL_MANAGER_HOME:-$HOME/.skill-manager}"/plugins/*/skills/git-issue-workflow; do [ -d "$d" ] && { printf %s "$d"; break; }; done)/scripts/bootstrap-home.sh --root <repo>`.
   This is the whole step. It is also exactly the `fix:` line `wt new` prints, in
   full and already absolute, when it meets a repository with no home — so an
   agent that never read this page arrives at the same command.
5. *Optional convenience:* copy this skill's `scripts/agent-home.sh` (the
   locator) into the repo's own `scripts/` so a human can type
   `scripts/agent-home.sh` instead of the path in step 4:
   `cp $(for d in "${SKILL_MANAGER_HOME:-$HOME/.skill-manager}"/skills/git-issue-workflow "${SKILL_MANAGER_HOME:-$HOME/.skill-manager}"/plugins/*/skills/git-issue-workflow; do [ -d "$d" ] && { printf %s "$d"; break; }; done)/scripts/agent-home.sh scripts/`.
   Skip it freely — nothing downstream requires the copy, and an agent should
   never have to check whether a given repo has one.
6. From then on, `new-change.sh` gives every worktree its own home. Nothing to
   remember and nothing to **export** — which is a statement about the
   environment, not a promise that the first launch will proceed. Expect the
   change-awareness gate (exit 8) on a new worktree and clear it with
   bare `skill-manager home drift`, then the same command plus `--ack`; see
   [the first launch is gated](#the-first-launch-is-gated-on-change-awareness-exit-8).

## Your Skill Manager home IS the worktree's

Three tiers, each a real copy, not a symlink: root `~/.skill-manager` → project
`<repo>/.skill-manager` → worktree `<worktree>/.skill-manager`, yours for this
ticket and gitignored. Copies, because a link is one shared object and two
tickets editing "their" copy would be editing each other's.

Two consequences, neither optional. **Launch through the home's shims**,
`<worktree>/.skill-manager/bin/launch/{claude,codex,gemini}`, or `skill-manager
exec` — exporting `SKILL_MANAGER_HOME` by hand gets you only the part you
remembered. And **an edit to a skill inside that home is in no diff**: the home
is gitignored, the PR cannot carry it, and `git worktree remove` deletes it
without a word. Getting it out is close-out step 4, and it is a gate.

Downward is a copy and needs nothing from you; **upward is the whole difficulty**.
Why the isolation needs the shims, what a home inherits versus declares, and how
to tell a broken home from a healthy one: `references/skill-homes.md`. **Do not
diagnose a new worktree home from the CLI source.**
