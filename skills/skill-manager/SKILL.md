  "install a skill", "what units are installed", "bind this doc-repo",
  "instantiate a harness", "resolve this skill project". This is the plumbing;
  for day-to-day lifecycle questions prefer the `skt` front door.

# skill-manager

Use `skill-manager` as the package manager for agent capability units:
skills, plugins, doc-repos, harnesses, skill projects, project child
homes, CLI tools, and MCP servers.

This skill should not mirror the whole CLI manual. For exact flags and
current command syntax, run:

```bash
skill-manager --help
skill-manager <command> --help
```

Some subcommands currently print usage after a validation or "unknown
option" banner; the usage text is still the source of truth.

## When to use

- The user asks what skills, plugins, doc-repos, or harnesses are
  available.
- The user asks to register, resolve, inspect, or operate a
  `skill-project.toml` / `skill-manager-project.toml`.
- The user asks to install, remove, publish, upgrade, sync, inspect, or
  scaffold a unit.
- The user is inside a project whose `.skill-manager` directory should
  be treated as a child Skill Manager home for agent launches.
- The user asks to bind or unbind a unit into a project, especially
  doc-repo markdown into `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md`.
- The user asks to instantiate, list, sync, or tear down a harness
  profile.
- The user asks to add, describe, deploy, or invoke an MCP server/tool
  that came from skill-manager.
- A task needs a CLI tool or MCP server that is not currently available,
  and a skill-manager unit may provide it.

Narrate the plan before commands that modify state. Install, uninstall,
publish, sync, bind, unbind, rebind, upgrade, and harness instantiate/rm
all change disk state or external registry state.

## Unit Model

skill-manager installs four unit kinds:

| Kind | Use when | Store path |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Skill | One focused agent capability. | `$SKILL_MANAGER_HOME/skills/<name>/` |
| Plugin | A bundle of skills plus plugin runtime surface such as hooks, commands, or agents. | `$SKILL_MANAGER_HOME/plugins/<name>/` |
| Doc-repo | Versioned markdown sources that bind into project `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md`. | `$SKILL_MANAGER_HOME/docs/<name>/` |
| Harness | A reusable project/agent profile composing skills, plugins, docs, and MCP tool selections. | `$SKILL_MANAGER_HOME/harnesses/<name>/` |

Use `skill-manager list` to see installed units, their kind, source, and
resolved git SHA. Use `skill-manager show <name>` for kind-specific
metadata and dependency attribution.

## Skill Projects

A skill project is a project checkout with a `skill-project.toml` or
`skill-manager-project.toml`. The manifest is portable intent: declared
skills, plugins, doc-repos, harnesses, project envs, libs, CLI deps, and
MCP deps. The generated files are projections of that manifest plus the
resolved lock state; do not edit generated `.skill-manager/` state as
the source of truth.

Use `skill-manager project register` to snapshot manifest intent under
the parent `$SKILL_MANAGER_HOME/projects/<name>/`. Use
`skill-manager project resolve` to install declared units, write the
project lock, scaffold the project `.skill-manager` as a child Skill
Manager home, and create `.claude`, `.codex`, and `.gemini` agent homes.
Launch agents from that checkout with:

```bash
SKILL_MANAGER_HOME=<project>/.skill-manager
CODEX_HOME=<project>/.codex
CLAUDE_HOME=<project>/.claude
GEMINI_HOME=<project>/.gemini
```

Use `skill-manager env sync <name>` to materialize project-local uv envs
under `.skill-manager/envs/<name>/` and `skill-manager env run <name>`
to execute through the generated env.

Homes come in tiers — root, project, worktree — each a real copy of the one
above it. **`references/projects.md` states that model and both upward paths;
read it there rather than from a summary here.** The one thing to carry before
you get there: never run `install`, `sync`, `bind`, `upgrade` or `project
resolve` before the local home exists — they write into whatever
`SKILL_MANAGER_HOME` names, which until then is the operator's global home.

See `references/projects.md` for the project workflow, child-home
relationship, the tier model and both upward paths, `[[vendored]]`
declarations, env docs, and cleanup rules.

For authoring unit manifests, scaffolding, TOML anatomy, and examples,
use the skt plugin's `unit-authoring` skill rather than this one.

## References

Load the focused reference instead of searching this file for detailed
flows:

- `references/workflows.md` - agent decision flows for install, bind,
  harness, sync, publish, CLI tools, gateway-backed MCP tools, and the
  modeled CLI workflow coverage table.
- `references/projects.md` - skill project manifests, project envs,
  project `.skill-manager` child homes, and agent launch homes. Also this
  unit's canonical statement of the **upward** path: the three home tiers and
  why each is a copy, `[[vendored]]` declarations, `home sync` (edit → the tier
  above), `unit publish` (edit → the unit's own repo), `home close-out` (refuse
  to discard a home that still holds work), and the rest of the `home` family.
  Go there for these symptoms too: *"publish says my unit is not a git
  checkout"*; *"which GitHub repository does this unit publish to?"*; *"my
  brief forbids writing the project home, so can I still publish?"*; *"a
  `skill-manager` on my `PATH` refused to run instead of running"*.
- `references/virtual-mcp-gateway.md` - the gateway architecture,
  virtual tool surface, deployment scopes, disclosure gate, and MCP
  troubleshooting.
- `references/cli.md` - CLI dependency authoring, managed binary
  resolution, and validation.
- `references/mcp.md` - MCP dependency authoring and gateway-side
  runtime usage.
- `references/skill-imports.md` - frontmatter `skill-imports` syntax,
  semantics, and validation.
- **Derived artifacts** — `artifacts list`, `artifacts stale`, cold shims,
  `skill-manager build <id>`, and what a clone inherits versus declares —
  are **not** documented here. The contract is stated once, in the skt
  plugin, at
  `${SKILL_MANAGER_HOME:-$HOME/.skill-manager}/plugins/tla-spec-dev/skills/skt/references/derived-artifacts.md`
  (absent in a home that does not have the tla-spec-dev plugin installed — then read
  `skills/skt/references/derived-artifacts.md` in
  `github.com/haydenrear/tla-spec-dev-plugin`, or install it with
  `skill-manager install github:haydenrear/tla-spec-dev-plugin`). Read it
  there rather than inferring it from this CLI's output or its source; the last
  two agents to work it out from source got it wrong, in opposite directions.
- `scripts/env.sh` / `scripts/env.py` - resolve absolute paths for
  installed CLI dependencies and agent-visible skill paths.

## CLI Boundaries

Use the CLI for install state, local projections, registry operations,
project manifests, child-home projections, gateway process lifecycle,
and lock maintenance.

Two answers agents most often go looking for:

- A unit missing from `skill-manager list` is **installed, not synced**:
  `skill-manager install github:<owner>/<repo>` (the coordinate names the
  repository, e.g. `github:haydenrear/git-issue-workflow-skill`). `sync` only
  refreshes a unit that is already installed.
- `install` has **no `--home`**. To install into a particular home, run that
  home's own entrypoint: `<home>/bin/cli/skill-manager install <source>`.

Prefer checking help before relying on remembered flags:

```bash
skill-manager --help
skill-manager install --help
skill-manager sync --help
skill-manager bind --help
skill-manager harness --help
skill-manager project --help
skill-manager env --help
skill-manager publish --help
```

Do not duplicate long command tables here. The CLI help already covers:

- Source forms such as registry names, `skill:`, `plugin:`, `doc:`,
  `harness:`, `github:owner/repo`, `git+https://...`, and local paths.
- Install planning, policy gates, and store/projection side effects.
- `sync`, `upgrade`, `lock`, `bind`, `unbind`, `rebind`, `bindings`,
  `harness`, `project`, `env`, `publish`, `registry`, `gateway`,
  `policy`, `pm`, and `cli` subcommands.

Keep skill-specific guidance to the things the CLI cannot decide for
the agent: which workflow to choose, what to inspect before mutating
state, and when to use gateway MCP tools instead of shell commands.

## MCP and CLI Tools

When a unit is installed, declared tools are resolved transitively: CLI
dependencies land under `$SKILL_MANAGER_HOME/bin/cli/`, MCP dependencies
register with the `virtual-mcp-gateway`, and plugins contribute deps from both
`skill-manager-plugin.toml` and contained skill manifests.

**Do not rely on the user's `PATH` for a CLI dependency.** Ask the helper for
absolute paths: `<skill-manager>/scripts/env.sh --pretty`. The
`skill-script:` fingerprinting rules, `--force-scripts`, the log locations and
what `uninstall` prunes are in `references/cli.md`.

**For MCP dependencies there is no CLI equivalent** — discovery, deployment and
invocation go through the gateway's virtual tools, and `describe_tool` must
precede `invoke_tool` in every session. Parameters, scopes, failure modes and
the disclosure gate are in `references/virtual-mcp-gateway.md`.

## Bindings and Harnesses

Install puts bytes in the store. Binding projects a unit into a target
root and records a reversible ledger under
`$SKILL_MANAGER_HOME/installed/<unit>.projections.json`.

- Skill/plugin binds create a symlink at the target root.
- Doc-repo binds copy tracked markdown under `docs/agents/` and insert
  managed imports into `CLAUDE.md` and/or `AGENTS.md`.
- Harness instantiation creates a named profile instance with its own
  bindings for skills, plugins, docs, and selected MCP exposure.
- Project resolution treats the project checkout as its harness and
  scaffolds `<project>/.skill-manager` as a child home containing the
  resolved project units and child-local tool shims.

Use CLI help for exact flags:

```bash
skill-manager bind --help
skill-manager bindings --help
skill-manager harness --help
```

Use `references/workflows.md` for the agent-level decision flow: when to
install only, when to bind, when to instantiate, and how to clean up.

## Lock, Policy, And Auth

`units.lock.toml` is updated atomically by install, sync, upgrade, and
uninstall. Use `skill-manager lock --help` and `skill-manager sync
--help` for current lock reconciliation flags.

Never bypass policy with `--yes` blindly. The plan output is the
security surface. If a plan reports `BLOCKED`, `CONFLICT`, or a
policy-gated category, surface it to the user and do not loosen
`~/.skill-manager/policy.toml` without explicit instruction.

Most reads work without login. Mutating registry operations such as
publish require authentication. If the CLI prints this banner, relay it
verbatim and pause until the user signs in:

```text
ACTION_REQUIRED: skill-manager login
Reason: <specifics>
Ask the user to run the following in their terminal, then retry the task:

    skill-manager login
```

Do not try to complete the browser login on the user's behalf.
