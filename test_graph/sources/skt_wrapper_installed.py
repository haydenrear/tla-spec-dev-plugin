"""skt.wrapper-installed — the thing skill-manager actually installs.

`skill-scripts/install-skt.sh` is the whole distribution story for this
repo: skill-manager runs it at install time, it picks an interpreter, it
writes ONE wrapper at `$SKILL_MANAGER_BIN_DIR/skt`, and every other
surface — the two hooks, `skt ticket`, an agent typing `skt status` —
reaches skt through that file and nothing else. The pytest suite imports
`skt.cli` directly and therefore never executes it.

This node executes it, once per PINNED interpreter.

WHY PINNED. `pyproject.toml` declares `requires-python = ">=3.11"`. That
is a claim, and until something runs the wrapper on the floor it stays a
claim: bare `python3` is 3.14 on the machine this was written on and
3.12 on a hosted runner, so an unpinned probe measures the box. The
matrix here is the same pair `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs pytest on,
and `SKT_PYTHON` — the installer's own documented override — is how the
interpreter is forced, so nothing is mocked to arrange it.

The wrapper paths this node publishes are the ONLY skt the downstream
nodes call. That is deliberate: a graph that imported `skt.cli` would be
a slower copy of the unit suite.
