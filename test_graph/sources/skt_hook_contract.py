"""skt.hook-contract — what the two shipped hooks leave behind.

`hooks/hooks.json` wires two shell hooks into every session that loads
the skt plugin, and both carry contracts a unit test cannot reach because
the contract IS the shell script, the environment it inherits, and the
file it appends to:

  SessionStart  appends EXACTLY ONE line to `<home>/logs/skt/hook.log`
                per invocation — the mode-independent proof that the
                startup report was present — and puts the report on
                stdout, which becomes session context. It NEVER exits
                non-zero: a broken orientation hook must not break the
                session it orients, so an unresolvable `skt` is a logged
                line and exit 0, not a failure.

  PostToolUse   surfaces the last check RESULT and never performs one.
                Its dedup key is (session, checked_at), so a fresh cache
                holding notifications injects ONCE and then stays silent
                for the rest of the TTL — not once per tool call. That
                regression was real (`fix: hook dedup is unconditional —
                the no-home-env session injected every tool call`), which
                is why it is driven here over five consecutive calls
                rather than one.

Both hooks are executed as the harness executes them: as scripts, with
an environment, against a real home on disk.
