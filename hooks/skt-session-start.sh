#   skt status: no skill-manager home found (checked $SKILL_MANAGER_HOME,
#   ancestor .skill-manager dirs, and the operator root)

# threw that away and injected nothing. The session then had no orientation AND
# no reason given, in exactly the situation -- a fresh workspace with no home --
# where orientation is worth the most. Measured in the eval lane: six runs, the
# hook returned 0 bytes every time, and the agent spent 7 to 11 Bash calls
# rediscovering what this line states.

# contract changes: still never exits non-zero, still bounded, still silent when
# there is genuinely nothing to say.
